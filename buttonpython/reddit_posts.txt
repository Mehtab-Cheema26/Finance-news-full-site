**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help **measure the trajectory of a security.**  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **"priced in"**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

Title: Reddit shares soar 16% on earnings beat and better-than-expected forecast
Text
 Reddit shares jumped 16% in extended trading on Tuesday after the social media company reported third-quarter results that topped analyst estimates and issued an optimistic forecast for the current period.

Here’s how the company did compared to LSEG estimates:

* **Earnings per share:** 16 cents vs. a loss of 7 cents
* **Revenue:** $348.4 million vs. $312.8 million expected

Reddit said fourth-quarter revenue will be between $385 million to $400 million, beating the average analyst estimate of $357.9 million. Adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter will be in the range of $110 million to $125 million, higher than the $85.2 million average estimate.

Revenue in the third quarter jumped 68% from a year earlier, and the company turned profitable, reporting net income of $29.9 million, compared to a net loss of $7.4 million during the same quarter a year ago.

The company said that its daily active users grew 47% year-over-year in the third quarter to 97.2 million, better than analyst estimates of 96.5 million.

Average revenue per user was $3.58 for the third quarter, which beat analyst estimates of $3.24.

“It was another strong quarter for Reddit and our communities as we achieved important milestones, including new levels of user traffic, revenue growth, and profitability,” Reddit CEO Steve Huffman said in a statement. “Reddit continues to be one of the most visited and trusted sites in the world with opportunities available to us that aren’t available to most companies.”

This is Reddit’s third earnings report since going public in March. The stock has more than doubled in value since its IPO, closing on Tuesday at $81.74, giving the company a market cap of $13.6 billion.

Since last year, Reddit has benefited from Google search updates that helped push its content higher in results, bringing in a flood of new users to the 19-year-old social media service. However, the newer users, which Reddit refers to as logged-out users, generate less online advertising revenue for the company than logged-in users, who typically spend more time on the platform, Reddit has detailed in financial filings.

The company said that global logged-out users grew 70% from a year earlier to 53.1 million, while global logged-in users increased 27% to 44.1 million.

Huffman told CNBC in August that the company has been making it easier for new users to create accounts and is developing more recommendation features to turn newbies into long-term users. He also said that Reddit’s direct traffic is “really resilient” to any Google search changes.

[By Marissa NewmanOctober 29, 2024 at 9:49 AM EDT](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/9984:JP) founder Masayoshi Son said [Nvidia Corp.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/NVDA:US) — the chipmaker that’s seen its market value skyrocket to over $3 trillion amid the artificial intelligence boom — is still undervalued, pushing back against the idea of an AI bubble.

“The future is much bigger,” Son said at the Future Investment Initiative conference in Riyadh on Tuesday. “Nvidia is just one example.”

Son said artificial superintelligence that’s 10,000 times more advanced than human intelligence will be developed by 2035. But he said hundreds of billions of dollars in investment will be needed to make this a reality. Softbank itself has already made some big bets on AI-powered services, contributing $500 million to an OpenAI funding round that [valued](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-10-02/openai-has-closed-new-funding-round-raising-over-6-5-billion) the ChatGPT maker at $157 billion.

Title: Prediction: Apple is grossly priced compared to Microsoft
Text
 Congrats to those that followed my last Costco post. I don’t believe anyone can really predict the ups and downs of the market, and with the current market climbing past ATH’s, the safest bets are going to be balanced long-short positions in specific equities or spread bets. 

**Apple**

* Market cap: 3.6T
* Current P/E: \~36
* Average P/E last 5 years: 28.6
* Historical revenue growth: Flat to single digits
* Earnings growth: Low double digits
* Net Margin: 25%

 **Microsoft**

* Market cap: 3.2T
* Microsoft P/E: \~36
* Average P/E last 5 years: 32.8
* Historical revenue growth: 15%
* Earnings growth: 15-20%
* Net margin: 35%

Last week, Apple had a higher P/E than MSFT, before this narrowed in the last few days Relative to Microsoft. Apple is still at historically high valuations relative to MSFT, despite Microsoft having better margins and growth. And the reasons are silly. Apple is getting a massive boost due to a "potential supercycle" with no proof that it’s actually happening (even the most optimistic projections are just slightly better than last year) and mediocre software releases, while Microsoft took a large hit last quarter because it forecasted larger capex and delays in direct GenAI revenue realization.

In my view, the market is pricing in a divergent and fundamental misunderstanding of GenAI and how it makes money. The Apple bull case hypothesis is correct, it’s just applied to the wrong company. The Microsoft supercycle isn’t going to be from direct GenAI subscriptions like Co-pilot, it’s going to be share shift towards Azure and increased utilization.

To me it is hopium to believe that retail consumers will be rushing aggressively to switch or upgrade their phones over a nascent GenAI capability that is inferior to its peers (other than privacy) and unlocks nominal value, while mid-large corporates won’t be doing the exact same for Microsoft for what is widely considered a top-notch set of capabilities and proven effectiveness in several emerging use cases.

Here’s my prediction – regardless of where the market goes, I believe there is going to be a strong and continued divergence between Microsoft &amp; Apple performance in the next few months, with at least another 5% gap between the winner and loser, with Microsoft’s P/E once against comfortably retaking the lead from Apple. Good luck and we'll see!

Tl;dr: Short Apple / Long Microsoft

P.S. Seeing a lot of people triggered by the tl;dr recommendation not having a basic understanding of what long-short position is. A balanced long-short position doesn't mean I believe Apple will go down on nominal terms, just that it will go down relative to Microsoft. Using options or a long-short position is the way to extract value when you see the spread in two equities increase.

Title: Visa earnings: $9.6B revenue, $5.3 GAAP net income, 13% dividend hike
Text
 Visa (NYSE:V)reported fourth-quarter earnings that surpassed analyst estimates, driven by robust revenue growth across its business segments. The company's shares rose 2% in after-hours trading following the announcement.

The global payments technology company reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $2.71 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, beating the analyst consensus of $2.58. Revenue for the quarter came in at $9.6 billion, exceeding the expected $9.49 billion and representing a 12% increase YoY on both a nominal and constant-dollar basis.

Visa's strong performance was underpinned by stable growth in key metrics. Payments volume for the three months ended September 30, 2024, increased 8% YoY on a constant-dollar basis. Cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe, rose 13% on a constant-dollar basis. Total processed transactions reached 61.5 billion, a 10% increase over the prior year.

Ryan McInerney, Chief Executive Officer of Visa, commented on the results: "Visa had a robust fourth quarter to finish a very strong fiscal year. In the fourth quarter, net revenue and GAAP EPS grew by 12% and 17%, respectively, driven by relatively stable growth in payments volume, cross-border volume and processed transactions plus strong momentum across new flows and value added services."

The company's board of directors approved a 13% increase in Visa's quarterly cash dividend to $0.590 per share, reflecting confidence in the company's financial position and future prospects.

For the full fiscal year 2024, Visa reported net revenue of $35.9 billion, a 10% increase on both a nominal and constant-dollar basis. The company's GAAP net income for the year was $19.7 billion, or $9.73 per share, while non-GAAP net income reached $20.4 billion, or $10.05 per share.

Title: Apple announces new and smaller Mac Mini with first redesign since 2010
Text
 Apple announced on Tuesday new Mac Mini models, featuring the first major redesign since 2010 that makes the desktop computer significantly smaller.

Aside from a redesign that shrunk the case and reduced the computer’s volume in half, the main upgrade on these new computers is that they include Apple’s latest chip, either the M4, or a more powerful version called the M4 Pro.

The Mac Mini is Apple’s least-expensive Mac, starting at $599, and does not include a display, which is sold separately. When the product line was first introduced in 2008, it was marketed as a computer for people switching from Microsoft Windows who could simply plug their existing keyboard, mouse and monitor into their new silver box.

The Mac Mini is not one of Apple’s highest-volume computers in terms of sales, but it is an important slot in Apple’s lineup, especially for people who make apps for iPhones and other Apple platforms. Many iPhone developers like to run a Mac Mini as a personal development server for coordinating uploads and code.

One improvement in the new design is that all of the ports are USB-C ports, the same more modern offering found on Apple’s laptops. There are three USB-C ports on the rear and two on the front, a new addition that will make it easier to plug or unplug accessories while the computer rests on a desk.

Apple said in a press release that the M4 is a significant improvement over the M2 chip in the previous version released in 2022. Graphics and games are more than twice as fast, and the M4 can support up to 14 CPU cores and 20 GPU cores, an increase over the past generation. Apple first introduced the M4 in May in Apple’s iPad Pro.

Apple is framing the new Mac Minis, like all of its new products announced this year, as built for Apple Intelligence, the company’s artificial intelligence system released this week. Apple has said a forthcoming integration of ChatGPT into writing fields inside apps such as Word will allow users to generate and rewrite text and emails using the system.

However, unlike on the iPhone, where only phones released in the past two years will support Apple Intelligence, all of Apple’s computers with the M1 chip and newer since 2020 can run the company’s AI. 

Apple’s Mac family remains a large business segment even though it is less important to the company than the iPhone. In the June quarter, Apple reported $7 billion in Mac sales, up about 2% on an annual basis.

Apple’s chief marketer previously teased a “week of announcements.” The company unveiled new iMac computers on Monday, so it seems plausible more is coming. This week’s new Macs are likely Apple’s last major hardware announcements for the year.

Title: Microsoft's GitHub goes beyond OpenAI, welcomes AI models from Anthropic, Google
Text
 Microsoft has a very expensive and very public relationship with artificial intelligence startup OpenAI. But one of Microsoft’s most successful AI products, GitHub Copilot, is now going beyond OpenAI to give developers more choice in what models they want to use.

GitHub, which Microsoft acquired in 2018, said in a blog post on Tuesday that developers will be able to power the GitHub Copilot Chat feature with Anthropic’s Claude 3.5 Sonnet model or Google’s Gemini 1.5 Pro model, as alternatives to OpenAI’s GPT-4o, if they choose.

“There is no one model to rule every scenario, and developers expect the agency to build with the models that work best for them,” GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke said in the post. “It is clear the next phase of AI code generation will not only be defined by multi-model functionality, but by multi-model choice. Today, we deliver just that.”

Microsoft introduced GitHub Copilot in 2021, offering source code suggestions to software developers. Copilot relies on models from OpenAI, which has received billions of dollars in funding from Microsoft and has exploded in popularity since releasing ChatGPT in late 2022.

OpenAI’s o1-preview and o1-mini, which are meant to reason over difficult problems, will also be available in the Copilot Chat on GitHub’s website and in the open-source Visual Studio Code text editor. They’re currently available in a public preview. Google’s model will be released in public preview in the next few weeks, a spokesperson said.

The arrival of the o1 models from OpenAI in September led GitHub to look at adding a dropdown menu for Copilot to provide more options, Dohmke said in an interview with CNBC last week. At that point, it felt like “the right time” to add models from Anthropic and Google, Dohmke said.

Developers will be able to see which model works best for a given programming language or employ the one that adheres to corporate requirements, he added.

Many other Microsoft products, including Teams and Windows, use OpenAI models. And Microsoft continues to provide computing power to OpenAI, which is now valued at $157 billion. But the relationship between the two companies has frayed in the past year, following the sudden ouster and reinstatement of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman in November. The dramatic incident reportedly angered Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella.

In February, Microsoft announced a partnership with early-stage AI model developer Mistral. The following month, Microsoft said it was hiring former DeepMind co-founder Mustafa Suleyman and employees of his startup, Inflection, whose Pi assistant competed with OpenAI’s popular ChatGPT. Over the summer, Microsoft named OpenAI as a competitor in a regulatory filing.

In the past month, GitHub has collaborated with engineering teams from Anthropic and Google on the safety, security and scalability of their models, Dohmke said.

“We are planning on extending that list in the future but have no partnerships to announce at this point,” he said, adding that GitHub wouldn’t want to overwhelm developers with too many choices.

Also on Tuesday, GitHub announced that its Copilot will gain the ability to perform speedy automated reviews of code updates through a public preview.

And GitHub showed a technical preview of a feature named Spark that can compose app prototypes based on text input and refine the designs with a few clicks. Developers will be able to modify the underlying code for the prototypes. Those interested in trying Spark can join a waiting list.

Once they receive access, people using Spark will be able to choose between GPT-4o and Anthropic’s Claude 3.5 Sonnet model, a GitHub spokesperson said.

Title: McDonald's reverses U.S. same-store sales declines in Q3; E. coli fallout looms
Text
 McDonald’s on Tuesday reported quarterly earnings and revenue that beat analysts’ expectations as its U.S. restaurants reversed last quarter’s same-store sales decline.

However, investors are worried about another dent to U.S. sales fueled by a recent E. coli outbreak across 13 states linked to McDonald’s Quarter Pounder burgers. As of Friday, 75 health cases have been tied to the outbreak, including one death of an older adult.

Health authorities have honed in on the burger’s slivered onions as the likely source, and McDonald’s has suspended its relationship with the supplier. Quarter Pounder burgers will return to affected restaurants on a rolling basis this week, sans slivered onions.

“While the situation appears to be contained, and though it didn’t affect Q3 numbers, it’s certainly an important development, which I know is on many of your minds,” CEO Chris Kempczinski told investors on the company’s earnings call, adding that McDonald’s was sorry and is committed to “making this right.”

Shares of the company fell more than 1% in premarket trading.

Here’s what the company reported for the period ended Sept. 30, compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $3.23 adjusted vs. $3.20 expected

Revenue: $6.87 billion vs. $6.82 billion expected

McDonald’s posted third-quarter net income of $2.26 billion, or $3.13 per share, down from $2.32 billion, or $3.17 per share, a year earlier.

Excluding certain items, the fast-food giant earned $3.23 per share.

Net sales rose 3% to $6.87 billion.

The chain’s global same-store sales fell 1.5%, a more drastic decline than the 0.6% that Wall Street was expecting, according to StreetAccount estimates, and was weighed down by the company’s international markets. It’s the second straight quarter that the company’s same-store sales have fallen.

“While we anticipated a challenging environment in 2024, our performance this year has fallen short of our expectations,” Kempczinski said.

U.S. same-store sales rose 0.3%, reversing last quarter’s same-store sales declines but still slightly weaker than the 0.5% increase predicted by StreetAccount estimates. Traffic to its U.S. restaurants was slightly negative, but the company credited its marketing and a $5 value meal launched in late June for the increase in sales.

Diners have pulled back their restaurant spending, leading McDonald’s and its rivals to lean into discounts and other marketing tricks to bring customers back to their restaurants. For example, in August, McDonald’s launched limited-time “Collector’s Edition” cups.

The company’s two international divisions both reported steeper declines in same-store sales compared with the prior quarter. The international operated markets segment, which includes France, Germany and Australia, saw same-store sales shrink 2.1%. The international developmental licensed markets division reported same-store sales declines of 3.5%, driven by weak demand in the Middle East and China.

Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, it’s unclear how the E. coli outbreak might affect U.S. sales, particularly as consumers have grown more picky about how to spend their money and where.

McDonald’s executives have taken steps to reassure customers that the company’s menu items are safe to eat, including pulling Quarter Pounder burgers from menus in the affected areas until its beef patties were cleared as the culprit.

Still, foot traffic to U.S. locations fell roughly 10% in the three days immediately following the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announcement last Tuesday of the E. coli outbreak tied to McDonald’s, according to a research note from Gordon Haskett Research Advisors.

Title: Chipotle misses revenue estimates as same-store sales growth disappoints
Text
 Chipotle Mexican Grill on Tuesday reported mixed quarterly results, despite another quarter of higher traffic to its restaurants. 

Here’s what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: 27 cents adjusted vs. 25 cents expected

Revenue: $2.79 billion vs. $2.82 billion expected

Chipotle reported third-quarter net income of $378.4 million, or 28 cents per share, up from $313.2 million, or 23 cents per share, a year earlier. 

The company’s food and beverage costs increased during the quarter, in part due to Chipotle’s decision to re-emphasize generous portions after social media-fueled backlash over the size of its burrito bowls this summer.

Excluding items, the company earned 27 cents per share.

Net sales climbed 13% to $2.79 billion. 

Same-store sales rose 6%, just shy of StreetAccount estimates of 6.3%. Traffic to restaurants increased 3.3% in the quarter, continuing the chain’s streak of bucking an overall slump in foot traffic across the industry. While many consumers have opted to eat out less, Chipotle has benefitted from having a wealthier customer base that’s willing to pay more for its burritos and bowls. 

During the third quarter, Chipotle brought back its popular smoked brisket for a limited time. It’s currently the most expensive protein, topping even the chain’s steak and beef barbacoa options.

Digital sales accounted for 34% of the chain’s quarterly food and beverage revenue.

The company opened 86 new locations during the quarter, 73 of which included a “Chipotlane” dedicated to online order pickup.

For the full year, Chipotle reiterated its outlook that same-store sales will grow by a mid- to high-single-digit percentage. The company also anticipates that it will open between 285 and 315 new restaurants this year.

Looking to 2025, Chipotle plans to open between 315 and 345 new locations. More than 80% of those restaurants will include a Chipotlane.

The earnings report marks the company’s first since CEO Brian Niccol departed to lead Starbucks’ turnaround. Chipotle’s board has tapped COO Scott Boatwright as the company’s interim chief executive.

Title: Boeing Co. launched a nearly $19 billion share sale, one of the largest ever by a public company to avoid being downgraded
Text
 &gt;Boeing Co. launched a nearly $19 billion share sale, one of the largest ever by a public company, to address the troubled planemaker’s liquidity needs and stave off a potential credit rating downgrade to junk.

&gt;The common-share portion alone would total just under $14 billion, based on Friday’s closing price of $155.01. That would be the largest US share sale since SoftBank Group Corp. sold part of its stake in T-Mobile US Inc. in 2020, data compiled by Bloomberg show.

&gt;The infusion of funds would clear one of new Chief Executive Officer Kelly Ortberg’s most urgent tasks. He is grappling with a balance sheet strained by years of turmoil and the fallout from a strike, now in its seventh week, that is crippling manufacturing of the company’s main cash cow, the 737 Max jetliner. Boeing needs the capital infusion to maintain its investment-grade rating and fund its production ramp-up once the walkout ends.

Title: TVGN seems to be building up potential
Text
 If you followed DRUG’s impressive growth, TVGN might be your next big opportunity. Over the past few months, Tevogen Bio (TVGN) has gained momentum, **surging by over 120%**, driven by a series of strategic advancements. Their recent confirmation of Nasdaq compliance adds financial credibility and shows a commitment to the rigorous standards that appeal to serious investors.

A key catalyst here is Tevogen’s new Letter of Intent with CD8 Technology, focusing on expanding their T-cell therapy capabilities. T-cell therapies are an area of high demand within biotech, appealing to investors due to their potential in treating complex diseases. With this partnership, Tevogen aims to take a leading role in personalized immunotherapies, a sector with substantial growth potential.

Tevogen AI, their dedicated artificial intelligence division, is also advancing drug development, mirroring strategies seen in other successful biotech companies. The AI-driven approach could accelerate drug discovery and deliver highly targeted therapies, positioning TVGN to benefit from trends that have proven profitable in similar cases, like DRUG’s trajectory.

Considering these factors, **many speculate that TVGN could soon reach double figures** as it continues its upward path. Anyone else watching this? Would love to hear thoughts on where you see TVGN going from here!

 Do we think it’s overvalued or undervalued or somewhere in between? There’s lots of variance in clean energy stocks for example, TSLA could be considered clean energy but so can NEE. 

I sold some lame duck clean energy stocks in 2021 in order to tax loss harvest but i’ve been interested in NEE as of late but not sure how long i’d end up holding to see profit. Is this a 10 year endeavor? 20+? I feel like we’ve all been talking about clean energy for the last 15 years but still hardly any movement on it.

Title: JPMorgan is suing customers accused of theft in viral 'infinite money glitch'
Text
 JPMorgan Chase has begun suing customers who allegedly stole thousands of dollars from ATMs by taking advantage of a technical glitch that allowed them to withdraw funds before a check bounced.

The bank on Monday filed lawsuits in at least three federal courts, taking aim at some of the people who withdrew the highest amounts in the so-called infinite money glitch that went viral on TikTok and other social media platforms in late August.

A Houston case involves a man who owes JPMorgan $290,939.47 after an unidentified accomplice deposited a counterfeit $335,000 check at an ATM, according to the bank.

“On August 29, 2024, a masked man deposited a check in Defendant’s Chase bank account in the amount of $335,000,” the bank said in the Texas filing. “After the check was deposited, Defendant began withdrawing the vast majority of the ill-gotten funds.”

JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, is investigating thousands of possible cases related to the “infinite money glitch,” though it hasn’t disclosed the scope of associated losses. Despite the waning use of paper checks as digital forms of payment gain popularity, they’re still a major avenue for fraud, resulting in $26.6 billion in losses globally last year, according to Nasdaq’s Global Financial Crime Report.

The infinite money glitch episode highlights the risk that social media can amplify vulnerabilities discovered at a financial institution. Videos began circulating in late August showing people celebrating the withdrawal of wads of cash from Chase ATMs shortly after bad checks were deposited.

Normally, banks only make available a fraction of the value of a check until it clears, which takes several days. JPMorgan says it closed the loophole a few days after it was discovered.

Miami and California

The other lawsuits filed Monday are in courts including Miami and the Central District of California, and involve cases where JPMorgan says customers owe the bank sums ranging from about $80,000 to $141,000.

Most cases being examined by the bank are for far smaller amounts, according to people with knowledge of the situation who declined to be identified speaking about the internal investigation.

In each case, JPMorgan says its security team reached out to the alleged fraudster, but it hasn’t been repaid for the phony checks, in violation of the deposit agreement that customers sign when creating an account with the bank.

JPMorgan is seeking the return of the stolen funds with interest and overdraft fees, as well as lawyers’ fees and, in some cases, punitive damages, according to the complaints.

Criminal cases?

The lawsuits are likely to be just the start of a wave of litigation meant to force customers to repay their debts and signal broadly that the bank won’t tolerate fraud, according to the people familiar. JPMorgan prioritized cases with large dollar amounts and indications of possible ties to organized crime, they said.

The civil cases are separate from potential criminal investigations; JPMorgan says it has also referred cases to law enforcement officials across the country.

“Fraud is a crime that impacts everyone and undermines trust in the banking system,” JPMorgan spokesman Drew Pusateri said in a statement to CNBC. “We’re pursuing these cases and actively cooperating with law enforcement to make sure if someone is committing fraud against Chase and its customers, they’re held accountable.”

 As the title said, I got offered a job as a contractor at a startup company (a private one). They demand 20hrs/week minimum, at 40$/hr. At the end end of the month, I'll get compensation in stock only based on the hours I worked. The contract also says the stock is at 1$ "preferred". How does it work ? I never got paid in stock before, and I have noo idea how to liquidate it when I need actual cash in my bank account. I live in Morocco. The company's abroad.

I have never sold or bought stock so any help is appreciated. Some of my questions are:  
What if need cash on hand? Can I just sell easily ?

What if there's no one to sell to ?

What if the company goes bankrupt ?

Should I contact my bank to convert the stock into money ?

Does it take long to convert ?

Is it as reliable as cash in your bank account ?

Also, any taxes I should worry about ?

EDIT ===========

Thank you all for the helpful comments ! I definitely won't take that job, might try to negotiate actual payment (prolly wont get it, but that's as far as I'll go.)

Title: Snap reports better-than-expected third-quarter results, issues light forecast
Text
 Snap reported better-than-expected third-quarter results on Tuesday, but issued light fourth-quarter guidance. The stock slipped in extended trading.

Here is how the company did:

* **Earnings per share:** 8 cents adjusted vs. 5 cents expected, according to LSEG
* **Revenue:** $1.37 billion vs. $1.36 billion expected, according to LSEG 
* **Global daily active users:** 443 million vs. 441 million expected, according to StreetAccount
* **Global average revenue per user:** $3.10 vs. $3.09 expected, according to StreetAccount

Snap said fourth-quarter sales will be between $1.51 billion and $1.56 billion. The midpoint of its guidance is $1.54 billion, which is below the average analyst estimate of $1.56 billion.

Snap said its adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter will be between $210 million and $260 million. The middle of the range is higher than analysts’ estimates of $230.7 million.

The company’s sales jumped 15% year over year in the third quarter while its net loss narrowed by 58% year over year in the third quarter to $153 million, compared to a net loss of $368 million a year prior.

The number of Snapchat+ paying subscribers is now at 12 million, the company said. That is up from the 11 million it reported in August. The company debuted its subscription service in 2022, pitching it as a way for users to experience exclusive and prerelease features for $3.99 a month.

Snap also announced a $500 million stock repurchase program on Tuesday.

“Our investments in AI and AR are powering new creative experiences for our community and driving innovation across our advertising platform, underpinning our long term growth opportunity,” Snap CEO Evan Spiegel said in a statement.

In September, Snap debuted the fifth generation of its Spectacles augmented reality glasses that people can wear to see digital imagery spliced into the physical world. The new Spectacles are only available to developers who must pay $99 a month for one year if they want to build AR apps for the glasses.

Shortly after Snap announced the new Spectacles, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg revealed the social networking giant’s experimental AR glasses called Orion. Meta’s Orion AR glasses have generated enthusiasm from employees and the company plans to attract developers next year in prelude for an eventual consumer launch.

In a letter to investors, Snap discussed the importance that developers play for the company’s Spectacles and AR initiatives.

“We aspire to be the most developer-friendly platform in the world, and we are excited to offer our new generation of Spectacles to developers as an invitation and inspiration to create new experiences,” Snap said in the letter.

Title: Ford guides to low end of 2024 earnings forecast as it slightly tops Wall Street's Q3 expectations
Text
 Ford Motor guided to the low end of its previously announced 2024 earnings forecast as it slightly topped Wall Street’s third-quarter expectations.

The Detroit automaker said Monday it now expects adjusted earnings before interest and taxes, or EBIT, of about $10 billion. It had previously guided to between $10 billion and $12 billion. It retained its forecast for adjusted free cash flow of between $7.5 billion and $8.5 billion.

Here’s how the company performed in the third quarter, compared with average estimates compiled by LSEG:

Earnings per share: 49 cents adj. vs. 47 cents adj. expected

Automotive revenue: $43.07 billion vs. $41.88 billion expected

The automaker was under pressure after a disappointing second quarter in which unexpected warranty costs caused the company to miss Wall Street’s earnings expectations.

Title: CVS Stock - owned 20 years; hold forever or sell?
Text
 I purchased CVS stock when I was an employee 20 years ago; their ESPP let me set aside part of my pay and buy the stock at a discount. I didn't have many other investments 20 years ago and other than letting the dividend drip over time, i never purchased anymore. My cost basis is around $22 per share.  It currently is 2% of my taxable brokerage account and under 1% of my total networth in CVS stock.  However it has been a dog the last few years and it is getting hammered.  

At such small exposure in my portfolio would you just leave it alone as a "lifetime" stock, or cash out at some point ant move on? It's not enough money to get crazy about and there is some interest in owning it for another 20 years too.

Title: Bloomberg’s estimates on the big four tech giants 
Text
 The big four tech giants are expected to spend a record $56 billion in total capital expenditures in the third quarter, according to the average estimate of analysts aggregated by Bloomberg. Much of that spending will go to NVIDIA and other AI-related device makers, with further increases expected in the coming quarters.
All signs point to continued strong AI-related spending. From chip device maker Asmax (ASML.US) to TSMC (TSM.US), AI has been a big part of this earnings season.
That backdrop has pushed NVIDIA shares higher, while Chief Executive Jen-Hsun Huang has assured that production of its new Blackwell chips is going well and demand is strong. NVIDIA is the biggest beneficiary of the big investment in artificial intelligence computing devices. The stock hit an all-time high last week and now has a market capitalization of about $3.5 trillion, slightly less than Apple (AAPL.US), which is still the world's most valuable company.
To be sure, there are concerns about the big tech companies' spending on artificial intelligence, as investors believe the billions of dollars these companies are investing are generating relatively little revenue. As such, this will be another focus of attention this week when these companies report earnings.
You have to walk the fine line of investing,“ said Paul Marino, chief revenue officer at Themes ETFs, ‘so that investors understand that you're ’not going too far”.
Nvidia's revenue is expected to more than double this year to $125.6 billion, according to the average forecast of analysts compiled by Bloomberg. Next year, the chipmaker's fiscal year 2026, sales are expected to grow 44 percent to $181 billion.
Of course, there are other companies benefiting from high AI spending, including Broadcom, Ultra Micro Computer and Dell Technologies.

Title: Help finding VOO eps or net income over 10 years (SP 500)
Text
 I'm trying to find the EPS of VOO over the last 10 to 15 years, so I can see the growth rate of earnings. Net income would work also. I've tried googling the answer and it's hard to find the information. I know it's an ETF, but I want to analyze the S&amp;P500 the same way you would a business. I suspect the earnings growth rate might be too low compared to what the SP500 sells for. It's very hard to find the information for some reason. Might just be me. I don't want to be buying something trading at a PE of 30 while earnings are growing at 5 percent. Please help.

Title: Election Play of a Lifetime - Logistics
Text
 10-Year Yields are up as market prices in the possibility of a republican sweep, paving the way for a potentially inflationary environment. 

Trumpy &amp; the good ol' party sweep the election, US throws down its big swinging hammer and tariffs the shit outta everything. 

Chinese get hit with the MAGA tariffs and then think shit, I have all this inventory but I can’t move it. US importers want me to pick up the tab. They think for all of 2 minutes, use that noggin and think “Russia’s sanctioned, but they just sell their energy products to other countries, and then they turn around and sell it to the countries unencumbered by sanctions” 

Meanwhile, markets throw a shit fit and logistics firms go down because those idiots think “oh no, trade war, nobody is going to be trading”. After about 2 days, people’s brains turn back on and think “oh wait, demand is fixed. People still need products like steel. How can they circumnavigate Tariffs quickly before they decide to pull a Toyota and open up satellites in US? Move product to a different country. 

Demand stays fixed. What has changed? Time to ship a product. Who benefits from increased shipping time? Well of course shipping &amp; logistics companies. 

Boom. 

Now I don’t know anything about shipping, but someone smart on here please do some research and tell me what I should look into buying lol. 

Disclaimer: I hate politics and don’t have a dog in this fight. Like most people, I think both candidates are kinda trash. My opinion is based on market sentiment, not what I necessarily think the outcome will be.

Title: Robinhood jumps into election trading
Text
 Upstart broker Robinhood is jumping into the prediction betting game, announcing Monday users can begin trading the 2024 presidential election that is eight days away.

Users can trade a Kamala Harris or Donald Trump contract starting Monday, said the company, as long as they meet certain criteria that include being a U.S. citizen. The trading is being offered through its Robinhood Derivatives unit and ForecastEx, which is operated by Interactive Brokers.

Robinhood jumps into a suddenly crowded politics prediction markets field that grew this month after platform Kalshi won a key ruling against the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which was seeking to stop the election outcome trading. The CFTC is appealing the ruling. Shortly after, Interactive Brokers launched various political contracts, including on the election.

The election markets have generated some controversary this year with some concerned about light volume allowing the markets to be skewed. International platform Polymarket said last week that a single French user was responsible for four accounts spending millions to buy the Trump contract. But Polymarket said an investigation found the trading was not manipulating the market.

“We believe event contracts give people a tool to engage in real-time decision-making, unlocking a new asset class that democratizes access to events as they unfold,” said Robinhood in a statement. For now, only the presidential election contracts will be available to trade on the system.

Odds and gambling platforms do not use methodologies used by traditional political polling, and therefore are not substitutes for political polls.

Title: Selling to rebuy in IRA
Text
 Long story short, I bought a large quantity of shares in a company back in March in my brokerage account that I now believe in on a longer time horizon than I did then.

I am considering selling 20% and buying them back in my Roth with some spare accessible cash I have sitting in there. Problem is, I'm up over 150% on the shares from March, so there will be some tax implications. 

This company does not do dividends now, but they keep dropping hints of them coming in the future. I'd be surprised if they came before 2026-2027, though. Obviously I'd rather them be in my IRA if that is to happen. 

I'm basically wondering if this would be an idiotic move as I am far from a tax expert. I know if i wait til March, it will change the tax status, but I'm expecting a positive move by then off some upcoming headwinds. 

Thank you for any help/advice. I left the ticker out to make it clear this is not a hype post. Have a great day.

Title: Cheaper to buy long call or protective put
Text
 Suppose I like a stock with current price of $100 and I am bullish but nervous and I have 2 options.

1.  But a call with 1 year expiring with strike 100

2. Or buy stock with cash. And a put with strike 100.

Both options are for 1 year and I intend to hold until expiry.

I wonder what is the better option then?

From my guess:

1. I should choose option which has less IV? 

2. If both have similar IV, I should choose option 2 because stock gains have better tax treatment?

Title: DOJ explaining why you should invest in Visa 
Text
 Excerpt is from their lawsuit against V


5. As a result, debit networks face what Visa calls "a chicken-and-egg problem." To be successful, the network needs many issuers and acquirers to accept the network. But issuers are unlikely to join the debit network unless many merchants already use the network. And merchants are unlikely to join the network unless their customers have cards that work with the network, which requires the issuer to have activated the network. As Visa itself observes, "build[ing] scale on both sides... with consumers/payers and with merchants/payees" is "a herculean task." Visa further recognizes that these effects create "an enormous moat" around its business.

6. Visa's market shares demonstrate just how deep that moat is. Visa has been the largest debit network in the United States for decades. Today, over 60% of all U.S. debit transactions run via Visa's payments network. And Visa's share of card-not-present debit transactions exceeds 65%. Mastercard is a distant second, processing less than 25% of all U.S. debit transactions and card-not-present U.S. debit transactions. Other networks, known as "PIN networks" because they originally facilitated ATM transactions for which accountholders needed to enter a PIN, are significantly smaller.

7. This moat is no accident. Coming out of the Great Recession, Visa identified two significant threats to its monopoly—one from legislation and one from emerging technology. Visa took steps to counter both, enriching itself handsomely in the process.

Title: Why Did Biogen’s Stock Drop Despite Strong Earnings and Analyst Upgrades (Aug 2024)?
Text
 I’m trying to understand why Biogen’s stock dropped right after its \*August 2024 earnings call\*, even though the company reported strong numbers, raised guidance, and received multiple analyst upgrades. All the indicators—company performance, analysts, and earnings—were positive, so why did the market seem to ignore these and push the stock down?

To be clear, I'm not looking to debate trading vs. investing strategies or the randomness of the stock market. My question is straightforward: given that both the company and the analysts seemed to signal "buy" or "hold," why did the market make an independent decision to sell?

Looking for some insights here, so if you don’t know or just want to yell ‘market’s random,’ kindly move along without blowing my mind. If anyone can provide insights on why this happened that’d be appreciated.

Thanks!

Title: Would the implementation of 24/5 trading at NYSE have implications for options and theta in general?
Text
 It’s already public news that the NYSE is setting forth the agenda of creating 22hr/day trading as a result of tensions from Robinhood’s trading hours. 

The question begets, let me preface this by saying I am in no means an options expert or have my toes dipped deep in the realms of options trading in general, but the natural question that arises from such an implementation would ultimately be - how does this affect option pricing and trading in general?

Currently, non-fut options are being traded from 9:30-5PM EST, that is a timespan of ~7-8 hours a day. Technically, if I’m able to trade options for 3x the duration, what would the underlying implications of this be in terms of delta and theta variances? There was always an implicit understanding that MMs would price options on Friday for next week with Sat/Sun theta in mind.

Just curious on your takes for the future options trading environment, and if there are any possible strategies to take note of in the future.

Title: COST, when will Costco split?
Text
 52 week high of $923.83, low of $540.23. Currently at $891.

P/E at 53% -- pretty high, but they are consistently growing, and growing at a consistent pace, 31 per year. Three states don't have a Costco, (now that they have one in Little Rock!!!!!) Rhode Island, West Virginia, and Wyoming -- wouldn't fit their model.

up 37% YTD, up 200% over the past 5 years.

Sales, revenue, all up year over year -- consistently. 2020 net income was 4 Billion, 2024 is on track for 7.3 Billion. Nearly double in four years.

Hasn't split in 25 years and gained 2780% since that split.

Their dividends are meek, except when they do special dividends (last one was $15/share in Dec '23). Current dividends are at $1.16 and they go up every year (four and up). So they should be considered a dividend aristocrat I suppose, except those special dividends kind of throw off the calculation.

I know that a split doesn't change the valuation of the company, just that it makes the stock more affordable to the average investor.

Title: What’s the stock you’ll never sell
Text
 Our investment philosophy and goals usually depend on our age. You probably wouldn’t accept the same risk at 20 than at 60, especially if your stock portfolio is part of your retirement plan.

I agree with a value investing philosophy, so to me never selling implies the original investment thesis doesn’t change. 

I think we could have an interesting discussion if we share our age (or age range) and the company in which we trust for the rest of our lives (and why).

I’m in my 30s, so assuming I live for the next 50 years, I believe Lockheed Martin ($LMT) will remain an important player in the defense sector, as I expect war (mostly proxy wars) to continue being used for political interests and if the US DoD sees its budget reduced, our current Western society’s paradigm will be over.

Other candidates I’ve considered are Visa ($V), Microsoft ($MSFT) and Amazon ($AMZN), but I could see all those titans being disrupted someday in the next 50 years.

How about you? What’s the stock you think you’ll never sell?

Title: Finviz Looking for Inverse Signals for Short/Put Candidates—What Do You Look For?

 Hi everyone,

Finviz screener question~ 


I keep seeing a lot of setups for potential long plays and short squeezes around here, but I’m curious about the flip side.

What indicators or setups do you look for when identifying good short or put candidates? I’m wondering about the best signals that suggest a stock could see a decline.

Are there any specific technical indicators, chart patterns, or fundamental red flags that tend to give you the green light? Or maybe particular market conditions that you feel make a short play more likely to pay off?

Any insights or setups you rely on would be awesome! Thanks in advance.

Title: Why Cancel shares instead of convert to Treasury shares during Buyback?
Text
 Greetings, when a company does share buybacks (i.e. share repurchase), my understanding is that it must either cancel those shares or hold them as treasury shares.

  
Why would a company cancel the shares as opposed to holding onto them as treasury shares?

  
My limited thinking would be that converting them to treasury shares would be better as: (1) the company would retain the ability to reissue them at a later date, (2) the company would limit outside ownership (e.g. prevent hostile takeover), and (3) the company would still retain the ability to always cancel the shares in the future.

Title: Do you ever look back at old r/stocks topics and wonder what people decided to do? Or how they feel about their takes ending up being right.
Text
 Or if the hot take was wrong? The reddit upvote system tends to favor saying what is popular that day. So a lot of threads become time capsules into a different area of thinking. One example were all those shorting NVDA threads on this sub in mid 2023 like this thread

Stock was at $31 split adjusted back then and people were saying time to short. Wonder how they feel with stock being higher.

Title: GSL Global Ship Lease -- value trap?
Text
 [GSL](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GSL&amp;ty=c&amp;p=d&amp;b=1) seems to offer great value on paper. 

* P/e and forward p/e of 2.6

* PEG of 0.22

* P/B of 0.63

* Dividend of 7%

* Dividend payout ratio of 18%

* Profit margin of 45%

* Free cash flow is fine



The greatest fault I can find is that its debt/equity ratio is high at 0.54 and it has issued a fair amount of long term debt recently. 

Despite strong operational performance, it's shown mediocre share performance. Over the last 10 years, it's had an annual return of only 1.6% including dividend reinvestment.

Conversely, the last 5 years would return 32% annually. 

It seems like it tanked in the 2015-16 selloff and never recovered. Yet today it's operating very profitably.

Why is this stock valued so lowly? 

What is the catch?

Title: Texas Roadhouse, Inc. Announces Third Quarter 2024 Results
Text
 Results for the 13 weeks ended September 24, 2024, as compared to the prior year as applicable, included the following:

Comparable restaurant sales increased 8.5% at company restaurants and increased 7.2% at domestic franchise restaurants

Average weekly sales at company restaurants were $149,176 of which $18,914 were to-go sales as compared to average weekly sales of $138,668 of which $17,058 were to-go sales in the prior year

Restaurant margin dollars increased 24.1% to $202.1 million from $162.8 million in the prior year primarily due to higher sales. Restaurant margin, as a percentage of restaurant and other sales, increased to 16.0% from 14.6% in the prior year driven primarily by higher sales. The benefit of a higher average guest check and improved labor productivity more than offset wage and other labor inflation of 4.7% and commodity inflation of 1.3%

Diluted earnings per share increased 32.5% primarily driven by higher restaurant margin dollars partially offset by higher general and administrative expenses and higher depreciation and amortization expenses

Seven company restaurants and three franchise restaurants were opened

Capital allocation spend included capital expenditures of $91.1 million, dividends of $40.7 million, and repurchases of common stock of $9.6 million.

Jerry Morgan, Chief Executive Officer of Texas Roadhouse, Inc. commented, “We are extremely pleased in such a competitive environment to report another quarter of continued traffic growth at each of our brands. This is a credit to the hard work of our operators who create an environment where Roadies want to work and guests want to dine.”

Morgan continued, “Looking ahead to 2025, we once again have a strong development pipeline and as of today already have 10 of our new company restaurants under construction. We remain confident that this new store growth along with our planned franchise acquisition and overall capital allocation strategy will allow us to continue to generate long-term shareholder value.”

The Company has tentatively agreed to acquire 13 domestic franchise restaurants with a targeted close date as of the beginning of our 2025 fiscal year. These acquisitions are subject to the completion of customary negotiations and due diligence.

Title: 75 people affected in E. coli outbreak linked to McDonald's Quarter Pounders: CDC
Text
 A deadly E. coli outbreak linked to McDonald’s Quarter Pounders has led to 75 cases in 13 states, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday, as it investigates the source of the spread. 

The outbreak has led to 22 hospitalizations and one previously reported death of an older adult in Colorado.

Out of 61 patients with information available, 22 have been hospitalized and two people have developed a serious condition that can cause kidney failure, called hemolytic uremic syndrome. All of the 42 people who were interviewed by the CDC reported eating at McDonald’s, while 39 people reported eating a beef hamburger, the agency said.

Those with infections ranged between ages 13 and 88, according to the CDC. The agency reiterated that the number of cases in the outbreak is likely much higher than what has been reported so far. The CDC added that the outbreak may not be limited to the states with related cases. That is because many patients do not test for E. coli and recover from an infection without receiving medical care, the CDC said. It also usually takes three to four weeks to determine if a sick person is part of an outbreak.

Shares of the restaurant chain fell 2% on the update. The stock is down 6% since the CDC announced the outbreak on Tuesday, initially citing 49 cases and one death across 10 states.

McDonald’s declined to comment on the update, citing the company’s statement when the outbreak was first announced.

Quarter Pounder hamburgers are a core menu item for McDonald’s, raking in billions of dollars annually.

Health officials are closely examining the slivered onions used in the Quarter Pounder as a likely contaminant. McDonald’s has instructed restaurants in the affected area to remove slivered onions from their supply, and has paused the distribution of that ingredient in the region.

McDonald’s stores in Colorado, Kansas, Utah, Wyoming as well as parts of Idaho, Iowa, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico and Oklahoma have temporarily stopped using Quarter Pounder slivered onions and beef patties, according to the CDC.

McDonald’s identified California-based produce giant Taylor Farms as the supplier for the sliced onions the company removed from its supply chain. Taylor Farms has issued a recall on four raw onion products due to potential E. coli contamination. Burger King, Pizza Hut, KFC and Taco Bell have pulled onions from select restaurants in response to the outbreak.

But federal agencies are also investigating the Quarter Pounder’s beef patty as a potential culprit.

As the CDC and other federal agencies trace cases and work to contain the outbreak, McDonald’s has pulled Quarter Pounders from restaurants in the affected areas. Around a fifth of McDonald’s U.S. restaurants are not selling Quarter Pounder burgers.

McDonald’s spokespeople said Wednesday that it is too early to tell if the outbreak is having any effect on traffic to its restaurants.

The company is expected to report its third-quarter earnings on Tuesday and could share more details with investors about the situation on the conference call.

The outbreak comes after several quarters of sluggish U.S. sales for McDonald’s. Price-sensitive consumers have not been visiting restaurants as much, leading McDonald’s and other fast-food chains to turn to value meals to boost sales. Wall Street analysts are expecting the company to report U.S. same-store sales growth of 0.5% for the third quarter, according to StreetAccount estimates.

For now, McDonald’s is trying to reassure customers that its menu items are safe to eat and drink and that it is taking the outbreak seriously. Experts told CNBC that barring a more serious crisis, the damage to its brand may be minimal, as with an E. coli outbreak linked to Wendy’s two years ago.

Title: NYSE plans to extend daily trading to 22 hours on its Arca exchange
Text
 [https://www.ft.com/content/59dc109d-d385-412a-bcc6-b671db9ce680](https://www.ft.com/content/59dc109d-d385-412a-bcc6-b671db9ce680)

&gt;The New York Stock Exchange announced plans to extend trading hours for equities on its Arca venue to 22 hours on weekdays, in an effort to meet global demand for buying and selling US-listed assets around the clock. NYSE, which is part of Intercontinental Exchange, said the extended trading hours for its all-electronic Arca exchange would cover 1:30am to 11:30pm Eastern time, excluding holidays. The proposed expansion, which targets a 2025 launch and is subject to approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission, follows the increased popularity in recent years of round-the-clock retail trading offered via brokerage platforms such as Robinhood and Interactive Brokers. “As the steward of the US capital markets, the NYSE is pleased to lead the way in enabling exchange-based trading for our US-listed companies and funds to investors in time zones across the globe,” Kevin Tyrrell, head of markets at the NYSE, said in a statement on Friday. NYSE plans to seek regulatory approval for the extended trading hours from the SEC as well as “US securities information processors”, such as the Consolidated Tape Association. The “tape” represents the official record of trading prices on exchanges, so the inclusion of night-time activity would be more likely to set the early tone for regular trading hours. NYSE Arca is best known as a venue for exchange traded funds and also hosts certain stocks and closed-end funds. Year-to-date, the Arca exchange has traded about $27.7bn a day in ETFs and about $21.8bn per day in corporate stocks, according to NYSE. It already has a broader operating window than the NYSE itself, with sessions running from 4am to 8pm Eastern time. Regular NYSE trading hours are 9.30am to 4pm Eastern time. Retail trading has boomed as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic and the increased salience of cryptocurrencies. Assets such as US Treasuries, currencies and stock index futures can already be traded outside of normal exchange hours. That trend has put pressure on NYSE to consider widening its trading hours, and earlier this year prompted the group to poll market participants on the merits of trading stocks around the clock. Some retail brokers already offer 24/7 trading where trades overnight are matched through a “dark pool” venue that matches night-time trades in the US with daytime buying and selling in Asia.

**Tl;dr:** NYSE Arca wants to change its trading hours from currently **4am - 8pm** to **1:30am - 11:30pm**. Needs SEC approval.

Title: Mizuho raises SoFi's target price to $14 from $12 before Earnings.
Text
 I found this in Reuters U.S. RESEARCH ROUNDUP publication from today at 7:13:01 AM ET.

SoFi is getting a lot of attention regarding earnings adjustments and price targets even before this 3rd quarter's earnings.

The institutions appear to be loading up before this earnings and they probably will publish more positive outlooks and price targets once they finish loading up and after this upcoming Q3 earnings scheduled to be announced on Tuesday, Oct 29th at 7 AM ET.

JMHO, I predict that SoFi's EPS will probably be $0.06 with an upbeat outlook.

Title: Killam Apartment REIT (KMP-UN.TO) residential reit below book value
Text
 Hey all,

Hoping someone may have some insight as to why this residential reit trades below book value with decreasing share price even with an environment I would think tends to favor residential real estate. Lowering of interest rates in Canada mixed with my worry of inflation forecast leaned me towards residential REIT.

They are in expansion mode quickly building/buying new condominium, revenue is up every year, property NOI growth exceeds 8%, the bulk of their portfolio lies in a favorable area for real estate, debt is under control, etc. Every metric leads me to believe this company is doing well &amp; will continue to do so.

So why would the share price not reflect that, I'm no smarter than the next guy although I work directly with stocks (though within the consumer sector) I do not have any insight on REIT's and my real estate knowledge is extremely limited.

They also dominate in one of Canada's fastest growing cities in term of sheer presence &amp; occupancy.

I have yet to do a deep dive on an exact share price but obviously trading below book value when everything seems good is highly unusual to me. I'd expect a company trading that low to have something terribly wrong or stronger headwinds within its business.

Here is their latest investor presentation. If anyone with a deeper understanding of REIT/overall restate within Atlantic Canada (note: geographical risk greatly reduced)

2. The second round is based on the actual current size of revenue &amp; total equity growth. Generally it must be at least +30% rev &amp; eq combined

3. Third round, consistency. Any "weird" financials, inconsistencies are tossed

4. Soft fourth for value, taking into account PEG and other price:financial metrics

5. Fifth leaves us with around 50. Sorted by the criteria above, keep top 10.

Title: When/how do you know it's time to sell your successful stock?
Text
 Hey. When it comes to huge companies, like Amazon, Nvidia and others, it's obvious you can and should keep their stocks when they give you significant profits, say, 11% in a month (unless there is something obvious that could crumble them ofc). 

But what about smaller companies that ppl find full of potential? I bought Celestica Inc. (CLS) stocks like a month ago. It's already given me about 15% (after yesterday's strong earnings report). I read articles where this company is stated promising etc, but I'd like to know when it is the best time to sell. 

It may rise even more which could lead to a lost profit for me, but what's the common strategy in such cases?

Title: Tesla stock has best day in over a decade on Musk's 2025 growth projection
Text
 Tesla shares soared 22% to close at $260.48 on Thursday, the stock’s best day since 2013, following the company’s better-than-expected earnings report.

The company late Wednesday reported revenue of $25.18 billion, which came in just under analysts’ expectations of $25.37 billion, but was up 8% compared with a year earlier. Tesla reported earnings per share of 72 cents adjusted, topping the average analyst estimate of 58 cents.

“We expect this surprising earnings beat to power a strong positive reaction in Tesla shares Thursday, given the degree to which investors have become conditioned to earnings misses from the company,” analysts at JPMorgan wrote in a note.

Tesla’s profit margins in the third quarter were boosted by $739 million in revenue for environmental regulatory credits, which the JPMorgan analysts noted were a “potentially unsustainable driver” of earnings and cash flow.

Automakers are required to obtain a certain amount of regulatory credits every year, and if they can’t meet the target, they can buy credits from other companies. Tesla has excess credits because it only makes electric vehicles.

Tesla earnings also got a boost from FSD, the company’s Full Self-Driving Supervised system. CFO Vaibhav Taneja said on the earnings call that FSD contributed $326 million in revenue in the quarter after Tesla made it available for use in the Cybertruck and added a feature called “Actually Smart Summon.”

CEO Elon Musk said on the call that his “best guess” is that “vehicle growth” will reach 20% to 30% next year, citing “lower cost vehicles” and the “advent of autonomy.” Analysts surveyed by FactSet were expecting delivery growth of about 15% for 2025.

Even bullish Deutsche Bank analysts doubted Musk’s forecast and wrote, in a note following the earnings report, “Our view remains more reserved at 10-15% (~2.03m),” and assumes Tesla can roll out a cheaper version of its Model Y at a price under $30,000 after subsidies, and other variants of the small SUV.

Analysts at Morgan Stanley who also recommend buying the stock, called Musk’s 2025 vehicle delivery growth prediction a “maybe.” They set their estimate at 14%.

It “clearly depends on the company’s ability to improve affordability through cheaper model (next gen) introduction, financing offers and improved features,” the Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a note Thursday.

A grain of salt

Musk said on the Wednesday call that Tesla plans to start production of its recently unveiled Cybercab, a robotaxi with butterfly doors and no steering wheel or pedals, by the end of 2026. He also said Tesla would conduct driverless ridehailing in California and Texas next year in its existing cars, which are not currently safe to use without a human driver ready to steer or brake at any time.

Bernstein analysts, who have a bearish price target of $120 on shares of Tesla, wrote in a note out Thursday: “The tone of Tesla’s conference call was ebullient and filled with Musk prognostications that have historically polarized bull and bear investors, and was more akin to a pep rally, with the company only taking two questions from sell-siders.”

Musk has for years promised shareholders a software upgrade that can turn Teslas into robotaxis. That hasn’t happened yet. Musk has also promised a refreshed version of the Tesla Roadster since 2017. The design of the vehicle is not yet complete. 

The Bernstein analysts wrote, “We continue to struggle to see Tesla overcoming the technological and regulatory hurdles needed to leapfrog current level 4 robotaxis, and believe fully unsupervised FSD could be years away.”

They pointed to Musk’s “long history of being overly optimistic about FSD” and said crowdsourced research that shows “Tesla continues to lag well behind competitors” on robotaxis.

The share rally Thursday was the sharpest since a 24% gain in May 2013. The jump erased Tesla’s loss for the year and left the stock up 3% in 2024, though it still trails the 22% gain for the Nasdaq.

Title: r/Stocks Daily Discussion &amp; Fundamentals Friday Oct 25, 2024

-----

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS &amp; revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

Title: CAVA Expansion Continues - Midwest Expansion Spotlight 
Text
 I will start this by saying I am probably too obsessed with CAVA. I have known the Company since 2017 and hold 550 shares with a $49 avg basis. 

Being in the greater Detroit area I can only get CAVA when I travel out east for business. This, I say with great enthusiasm, is about to change. Through meticulous stalking of CAVA’s job postings, I have discovered that it is the Company’s intention to expand from their initial  entry in the Midwest market (Chicago) to both the Indianapolis and Detroit areas.

The timeline is uncertain, but if I were to guess, there could be up to four store locations around each city by YE 2025.

CAVA has had enormous success since their summer 2023 IPO (up 208%). The Company has around 330 locations across 28 states, with a stated goal of 1000 locations by 2032. There are concerns from some that the Company is currently way overvalued, while others contend that the market is only pricing in some of the growth and white space ahead. Regardless, I am very much looking forward to having this option near me. 

Cheers!

Title: Is $SMR facing badluck or it will eventually breakthough?
Text
 Badluck

1. This past November, the Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems, or UAMPS, terminated what was to be “the first NuScale Power small modular reactor plant to begin operation in the United States.” This was a death foretold; the red flags have been obvious for years now.

https://www.utilitydive.com/news/nuscale-uamps-project-small-modular-reactor-ramanasmr-/705717/

2. NuScale also didn't make the final cut to build SMR in the UK

&gt;US company eliminated from race to build Britain’s first mini-nuclear plant

https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2024/09/25/us-firm-eliminated-from-race-build-britain-first-mini-nuke/

The naysayers are stating due to unproven technology, nobody wants to be the 1st guinea pig.  It is costly upfront and if something goes wrong they might be on hook in fines and penalties (hazardous material handling).

But this said... recently, the Biden admin has greenlit financial assistance approval for nuclear energy related projects.  

China and Russia already have approved SMRs and I believe they have a few already up and running.  

The unfairness is that - their gov't can absorb the costs if something goes wrong. 

Questions

1. Why doesn't the US gov't go a little deeper into the projects and bear some of the costs/potential dangers associated with it? 

2. Big companies like Amazon and Google have signed up partnerships with energy companies for SMR to be designed/built.  Why don't they just partner with a company like NuScale instead (approved SMR design)?

At the end of day, in 10 years... if energy infrastructure stays the way it is - the US could be way behind Russia/China in terms of energy source/efficienct. Nevermind inability to power many data centers etc. and not ability to meet its clean energy goals. 

Thoughts?

Title: How can I report capital loss on a stock when it's untradeable so I can't sell?
Text
 On Robinhood I have TLGTQ that almost went bankruptcy 3 years ago or so and now the price is $0.0002.

I had $1,000 worth of it but now value is $0 so I want to report a loss of $1,000 but since I can't sell it, Robinhood can't send me form 1099..

What can i do?

2nd question is, in whatever fiscal year this becomes tradeable and I sell and have $1,000 capital loss, does it still lower my total taxable income by $1,000 for tax filing even if I dont have any other capital gains from other stocks? (Meaning no other stock selling activities in that fiscal year other than loss from this TLGTQ stock)

Hope this makes sense and hope to get your advice.. thanks!

Title: Tesla shares jump 6% on profit beat
Text
 * Tesla reported third-quarter earnings on Wednesday that topped analysts’ estimates even as revenue came in just shy of expectations.

Here’s what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

* **Earnings per share:** 72 cents vs. 58 cents expected
* **Revenue:** $25.18 billion vs. $25.37 billion expected

Revenue increased 8% in the quarter from $23.35 billion a year earlier. Net income rose to about $2.17 billion, or 62 cents a share, from $1.85 billion, or 53 cents s share, a year ago.

Tesla’s profit margins were bolstered by $739 million in automotive regulatory credit revenue during the quarter. The company has also been offering an array of discounts and incentives to spur sales.

Automotive revenue increased 2% to $20 billion from $19.63 billion in the same period a year earlier. Energy generation and storage revenue soared 52% to $2.38 billion, while services and other revenue jumped 29% to $2.79 billion.

Operating margin was reported at 10.8% of sales to improve from last quarter's mark of 6.3%, and top last year's mark of 7.6%. Total GAAP gross margin was 19.8% vs. 17.9% a year ago and 18.0% in the prior quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $4.67 billion vs. $3.76 billion a year ago. For the quarter, the EV juggernaut's adjusted EBITDA margin rose to 18.5% of sales from 16.1% a year ago.

# 

Tesla had already disclosed 462,890 deliveries for Q3. The electric vehicle maker said it produced 469,796 vehicles during the quarter. Tesla noted that 3% of the deliveries were subject to operating lease accounting. For reference, Tesla delivered 443,956 vehicles in Q2 of this year and 435,059 vehicles in Q3 of last year. Tesla's  all-time deliveries record was 484,507 vehicles in Q4 of 2023. Looking ahead, Tesla reiterated that plans for new vehicles, including more affordable models, remain on track for start of production in the first half of 2025.

# More than just EVs

Tesla said energy storage deployments decreased sequentially in Q3 to a record 6.9 GWh, but were up 75% Y/Y. Overall, Tesla said energy services and other businesses are becoming increasingly profitable parts of the company. "As energy storage products continue to ramp, and our vehicle fleet continues to grow, we are expecting continued profit growth from these businesses over time," noted TSLA. The company also said that it deployed and is training ahead of schedule on a 29k H100 cluster at Gigafactory Texas, where it expects to have 50k H100 capacity by the end of October.

# Balance sheet

Tesla ended the quarter with a cash position of $33.6 billion. The sequential increase of $2.9 billion was a result of positive free cash flow of $2.7 billion. Operating cash flow was $6.3 billion during the quarter.

**SUMMARY**

We delivered strong results in Q3 with growth in vehicle deliveries both sequentially and year-on-year, resulting in record third-quarter volumes. We also recognized our second-highest quarter of regulatory credit revenues as other OEMs are still behind on meeting emissions requirements.

Our cost of goods sold (COGS) per vehicle came down to its lowest level ever at \~$35,100. In order to continue accelerating the world’s transition to sustainable energy, we need to make EVs affordable for everyone, including making total cost of ownership per mile competitive with all forms of transportation. Preparations remain underway for our offering of new vehicles – including more affordable models – which we will begin launching in the first half of 2025. At our "We, Robot" event on October 10, we detailed our long-term goal of offering autonomous transport with a cost per mile below rideshare, personal car ownership, and even public transit.

The Energy business achieved another strong quarter with a record gross margin. Additionally, the Megafactory in Lathrop produced 200 Megapacks in a week, and Powerwall deployments reached a record for the second quarter in a row as we continue to ramp Powerwall 3.

Despite sustained macroeconomic headwinds and others pulling back on EV investments, we remain focused on expanding our vehicle and energy product lineup, reducing costs and making critical investments in AI projects and production capacity. We believe these efforts will allow us to capitalize on the ongoing transition in the transportation and energy sectors.

Title: tax harvesting question 
Text
 in 2023 tax year I had $10,000 in stock losses. I used $3,000 last year to bring down my taxable income and am able to carryover $7000 (but use only $3000) this year 2024. This year, I have some stocks that I can sell for a gain (if I sell all, total gain is about $12,000). Should I sell it to meet the $3000 limit so I will not have to pay taxes on that $3000 gain that I made and I can maximize the benefit of the $3000/y carryover? Does it make a difference if I use it toward this stock gain vs bringing down my taxable income? Am I understanding this correctly?

Title: Nvidia supplier SK Hynix posts record Q3 profit, beats forecasts
Text
 SEOUL (Reuters) -South Korea's SK Hynix on Thursday posted a record quarterly profit as the Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) supplier saw strong sales of its advanced chips such as high bandwidth memory (HBM) ones used in generative AI chipsets.

The world's second-biggest memory chipmaker reported a 7 trillion won ($5.07 billion) operating profit for the July-September quarter versus a 1.8 trillion won loss a year earlier.

That compared with a 6.8 trillion won average forecast by LSEG SmartEstimate, which is weighted toward analysts who are more consistently accurate.

SK Hynix has outperformed rivals Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) and Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) in recent quarters, as it has benefited the most from AI-driven appetite for high-end memory chips following its early entry and large investments in HBM chip development.

"HBM sales showed excellent growth, up more than 70% from the previous quarter and more than 330% from the same period last year," SK Hynix said in a statement.

SK Hynix sees HBM sales making up 40% of its total DRAM revenue in the fourth quarter, up from 30% in the third quarter, and added it expects memory chip demand for AI servers to grow further next year as global tech companies continue developing generative AI.

Revenue for the quarter rose 94% year-on-year to 17.6 trillion won.

SK Hynix shares have jumped 38.5% so far this year, outperforming Samsung, whose stocks has slumped 24.7% over the same period.

Last month, SK Hynix, the main supplier of HBM chips to Nvidia, said it had started mass production of HBM3E 12-layer chips and plans to supply the latest products to unidentified customers by the end of this year.

Title: Are you convinced Tesla is back to growth?
Text
 There were bets on the stock going either way on earnings, but nobody predicted such a decisive beat on auto gross margins and EPS. For the first time in almost 3 years, the pump is halfway justified by fundamentals. 

Is this trend reversal in Q3 sustainable in the coming quarters? Is the stock going to finally stop yoyoing on non-events and track earnings again?

Title: Short Term Earnings on Quarterlies? Good Strategy?

 For example, tonight the TXRH quarterly earnings become public. Based on past events and stock trends... wouldn't it be profitable to buy shares right before the release and then let the stock soar the next day and with that, dump, and make profit?

Title: Earnings Database that auto-updates
Text
 First off, if anyone knows of a service that provides the above, LMK. Earnings Whisper might, but whether they include screen pics of the price action of previous quarters, I do not know.

Secondly, I've created my own record of earnings behaviors over a couple of years of quarters. Each folder named after the stock ticker includes screenshots of past earnings behaviors. Thing is, I can not stand to move the folders every quarterly cycle. It's a lot of tedious work. Yes I could stick to a selection but I'm ambitious. 

Many hit the same day of the week of the quarter, but most do not hit the exact same day. Can anyone think of the best approach that I could keep these folders, but they would auto update to the upcoming date of the earnings? Maybe I need to put these folders in a calendar that can suck in data. Schwab TOS has a good calendar. I wish I could dump my folders of screenpics into an extension of their calendar.

I know Google sheets has stock ticker data that autofills price. I don't know if coming earnings date is a field that auto updates. If it did, I assume I could dump my entire folder into that google sheets folder MAYBE.

Thanks!

Title: US SEC is having a set of eyes targeting at the short sellers.

 * The SEC accused Ryan Choi of "negligently engaging in a scheme to defraud" the readers of Citron Research in connection with two social media posts with recommendations to buy two US stocks.
* Choi agreed to pay $1.8 million to the SEC to settle the charges.
* The settlement is likely to be a blow to Andrew Left, an activist short seller and the founder of Citron Research who is fighting SEC and Department of Justice charges filed in July alleging he engaged in a scheme to defraud Citron Research followers by publishing false and misleading statements regarding his stock trading recommendations.
* The authorities in Los Angeles claimed Andrew Left generated at least $16 million in illegal trading profits through stock manipulation. Prosecutors and regulators accused him of using his fame to tell investors to do one thing while he traded the other way.
* The SEC called it a “bait and switch” strategy.  Mr. Left apparently bought back stock immediately after telling his readers to sell, and he sold stocks immediately after telling his readers to buy.
* Federal prosecutors claim Mr. Left used exaggerated language in his commentary and manipulated stock prices with his social media posts.

Title: Coca-Cola Non-GAAP EPS of $0.77 beats by $0.02, revenue of $11.9B beats by $290M, Shares -2% PM
Text
 

KO Revenue of $11.9B (-0.8% YY) beats by $290M. Organic Revenues (Non-GAAP) Grew 9%.

Revenue performance included 10% growth in price/mix and a 2% decline in concentrate sales. Concentrate sales were 1 point behind unit case volume, primarily due to the timing of concentrate shipments.

**Full Year 2024**

For comparable net revenues (non-GAAP), the company expects a 4% to 5% headwind from acquisitions, divestitures and structural changes. Comparable EPS (non-GAAP) is expected to include a 1% to 2% headwind from acquisitions, divestitures and structural changes. — No Update

The company expects to deliver comparable currency neutral EPS (non-GAAP) growth of 14% to 15%. — Updated

The company expects comparable EPS (non-GAAP) growth of 5% to 8%, versus $2.69 in 2023. — No Update

The company expects to generate free cash flow excluding the IRS tax litigation deposit (non-GAAP) of approximately $9.2 billion.

**Fourth Quarter 2024 Considerations** 

Comparable net revenues (non-GAAP) are expected to include an approximate 4% currency headwind based on the current rates and including the impact of hedged positions, in addition to a 4% to 5% headwind from acquisitions, divestitures and structural changes.

**Full Year 2025 Considerations**

Comparable net revenues (non-GAAP) are expected to include a low single-digit currency headwind based on the current rates and including the impact of hedged positions.

  
Key Takeaways:

Organic sales shine again Organic revenue rose 11% during the quarter vs a 9.3% consensus estimate, with unit case volume up +2% and Latin America up +12%. The organic sales growth outpaced PepsiCo's 9.3% mark in a recently completed period. Unit case volume was down 1% for Coca-Cola globally during the quarter, with growth led by Brazil, the Philippines and Japan but more than offset by declines in China and Türkiye.

North America outperforms Unit case volume in North America showed flat growth in trademark Coca-Cola products, while water, sports, coffee and other beverages saw mixed results. Price/mix grew 11%, driven by favorable mix and pricing actions in the marketplace. Operating income grew 10%, benefiting from organic revenue growth.

Margins march higher Consolidated comparable operating margin rose 90 basis points to 29.7% in the period. This improvement was primarily driven by strong organic revenue growth and restructuring bottling operations, partially offset by currency headwinds.

Looking ahead Coca-Cola sees full-year adjusted organic revenue growth of +10% vs +9.0% consensus. The company expects to deliver comparable currency neutral EPS growth of +14% to +15%.

Comparable EPS (non-GAAP) percentage growth is expected to include a mid-single digit currency headwind based on the current rates and including the impact of hedged positions.

Title: Starbucks shares slide after preliminary results show sales fell again
Text
 Starbucks on Tuesday posted preliminary quarterly results, which showed its sales fell again.

Nearly two months ago, CEO Brian Niccol took the helm of the coffee giant after two quarters of same-store sales declines.

He aims to reverse slowing demand for Starbucks’ drinks, particularly in its two largest markets: the United States and China. In the U.S., the chain has been losing its occasional customers, who have opted to save money instead of spending on its macchiatos and Refreshers. Starbucks’ business in China has also been struggling to recover ever since the pandemic, and the rise of cheaper local rivals like Luckin Coffee and a more cautious consumer have dented sales in recent months.

Niccol joined Starbucks after six years as CEO of Chipotle; during his tenure at the fast-casual chain, he led the company through a turnaround after its foodborne illness crises, invested in its digital business and turned it into a top industry performer, even during the pandemic.

To curb Starbucks’ sales slump, Niccol plans to turn first to the company’s struggling U.S. business. In an open letter released during his first week on the job, he said he plans to focus on four areas of improvement: the barista experience, morning service, its cafes and the company’s branding.

Niccol has also been reshuffling the company’s executive ranks. On Friday, the company announced a former Chipotle executive, Tressie Lieberman, will be joining Starbucks as its global chief brand officer, a newly created position. And last month, Starbucks said its North American CEO Michael Conway would retire after just five months in the role; Niccol’s predecessor Laxman Narasimhan had appointed Conway before his ouster in August.

Shares of Starbucks are up 1% this year, as of Tuesday’s close. The company has a market cap of more than $109 billion.

The company is expected to report its fiscal-fourth quarter earnings after the bell on Oct. 30.

Title: Three stocks that you feel will outperform the market over the next 5 years
Text
 Like the title says: which three stocks, individual equities, do you believe will outperform the market, Market Index Funds: VOO, ONEQ, or DIA?

My takes:

COST -- Costco has a great expansion model, a great business model, and loyalty like few other companies: customer, employee, and vendors.

AAPL -- I continue to see them innovate, they won't stick with something that isn't working, and their stuff just works.

Third slot is a bit tougher: GOOG, NVDA, or JPM in that order.

Title: Lockheed Martin Stock Sinks as F-35 Sales Decline Weighs on Revenue
Text
 Lockheed Martin (LMT) shares tumbled Tuesday as the defense contractor missed revenue estimates on a drop in aerospace sales.

The company reported third-quarter revenue rose 1% year-over-year to $17.10 billion, while analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha were looking for $17.38 billion. Earnings per share (EPS) of $6.80 exceeded forecasts.

Lockheed's Aeronautics unit sales declined 3% to $6.49 billion, primarily because of delays in contractual authorization and funding for the F-35 fighter jet. Sales at its Space division were down less than 1% to $3.08 billion. Missiles and Fire Control segment revenue jumped 8% to $3.18 billion, and Rotary and Mission Systems unit revenue was 6% higher at $4.37 billion.

The company raised its full-year EPS outlook to $26.65 from a range of $26.10 to $26.60, and narrowed its revenue outlook to $71.25 billion from the previous $70.50 billion to $71.50 billion. 

Shares of Lockheed Martin hit an all-time high yesterday, and even with today's roughly 5% declines they're up nearly 30% year-to-date.

Title: Tesla’s Not a Car Company, Musk’s in the Business of Selling the Future. And 5 Other Things to Know Today.
Text
 

It may surprise some to learn that Tesla isn’t really in the car business.

Sure, some 80% of its revenue currently comes from electric vehicles. And CEO Elon Musk is pretty good at squeezing profit out of those cars—something many in the industry still haven’t managed to figure out.

But the most important thing to know about the company is that it trades on more than 70 times forward earnings. Ford and General Motors are on five or six times. This suggests that when investors buy Tesla stock, their expectations are in a different universe from when they buy into other car makers.

Musk is pulling old-school levers to ensure his cars are profitable, even as rivals churn out lower-cost models. It helps that Tesla can now make more vehicles from the same manufacturing base and squeeze suppliers to cushion margins.

At the same time, a closer look at the earnings yesterday—which beat Wall Street estimates—show Tesla’s profits come from plenty of other sources. It made money from software, from selling regulatory credits for making more than its share of zero-emission cars, and from battery storage and charging.

Of course, robotaxis and self-driving cars are the next frontier. They’re not really cars—the robotaxi won’t even have a steering wheel or pedals. They are a bet on technology and artificial intelligence, not the automotive industry. It’s why Tesla is one of Nvidia’s best customers.

There’s a story about Ray Kroc, the businessman who made McDonald’s the most successful fast-food corporation, and the value of knowing exactly what business you’re really in. For McDonald’s, it’s real estate, not hamburgers.

Elon Musk knows he’s not in the car business. He’s selling the future. The tricky part will be delivering on his promises when expectations are already so high.

Title: Best way to deal with a stock that 10x'd and is now a significant part of your portfolio?
Text
 NVDA is now over 50% of my portfolio, with 900% gains since I bought it a few years back.

This makes me uncomfortable, I would like to diversify and spread my risk out a bit to other stocks / ETFs. 

NVDA is sitting in a regular brokerage account currently, so if I sell any portion of it I would be subject to long term capital gains. I also have a 401k and a Roth IRA. Are there any creative ways to shift the stock over to those portfolios to save on tax?

Title: Plantir Opinions from Technical People who actually use it

 All the hype about this stock must be from people who don't understand the technology. What they are doing isn't magic, and can be done with less vendor lock-in by a number of other cloud technologies. Palantir is just good at selling a pipe dream to the C-suite. 

As Scott Galloway mentioned, this company is more similar to Microstrategy (excluding their Bitcoin stuff ) than other companies. 

I'm just going to drop this link to a thread of opinions from people who have actually used or implemented it in their businesses and let that help you form an opinion on the stock:

 This is a nuclear energy co. that Sam Altman initially seed funded. Price went up over 100% in past 5 days ($9 to $22) after increased interest in AI turning to nuclear energy sources. The company looks good and is/was close to having a contract with the Air Force and has received permits to build in ID . But Cathie Wood sold her shares today, (and bought shares in another NE co. - BWXT) and price dropped to $20 but was as low as $18.50. Do you think this signals a large sell-off after initial surge? Price target (old?I) is around $10.  I'm new to this! I love this sector but don't want to get in too early.

 After my post about Goldman Sachs S&amp;P500 forecast for the next 10 years (https://www.reddit.com/r/eupersonalfinance/s/8uorwocLOz) got pretty good discussion with a lot of different views and opinions, I decided to collect all  S&amp;P500 forecasts for 2025 that I can find in media published in the last 30 days. So here are predictions I have found:

POSITIVE:

UBS says SP&amp;500 could reach 6,600 by the end of 2025 which is 13% up from current level.

Goldman Sachs says S&amp;P500 will reach 6,000 by the end of 2024 and 6,300 by the end of 2025.

NEGATIVE:

Barry Bannister (chief equity strategist at Stifel) says that S&amp;P500 in 2025 will return to where 2024 began (that is at 4,609).

Title: Peloton partners with Costco to sell Bike+ as it looks to reach young, wealthy customers
Text
 Peloton’s stationary bikes will soon sell at Costco’s stores and on its website as the beleaguered fitness company looks for new ways to reach younger and affluent customers, Peloton is set to announce Tuesday.

Under the terms of the deal, Costco will offer Peloton’s Bike+ in 300 of its U.S. stores for $1,999, and on Costco.com for $2,199 between Nov. 1 and Feb. 15. It is a steep discount from the typical price of the Bike+, which is selling on Peloton’s website for $2,495. It is unclear how the price will compare to any holiday promotions Peloton plans to offer. 

The new partnership comes during a state of transition for Peloton, which is being led by two board members after its former CEO Barry McCarthy stepped down earlier this year.

Long focused on growth at all costs, Peloton has turned its sights to profitability and has had to become more creative as it tries to reach new users.

As sales fall and losses mount, Peloton is looking for cheaper ways to attract new customers. Costco is one way to get there, Dion Camp Sanders, Peloton’s chief emerging business officer, told CNBC in an interview. 

“We’ve been able to architect a deal with Costco that meets our needs with regard to profitable, sustainable unit economics, while at the same time delivering robust and clear value to Costco members,” said Camp Sanders. “We’ve structured this deal with Costco to both meet our needs for profitable, sustainable growth and getting us access to Costco’s very large net incremental audience.” 

Camp Sanders said Peloton’s partnership with Costco is only for a limited time because fitness is a seasonal category for the company, but Peloton hopes to keep building on the relationship and perhaps expand it to future locations both in the U.S. and abroad.

The deal with Costco gets Peloton onto the shelves of a retailer with a strong fan following and wealthier customers. The membership-based club has gained popularity as shoppers across all incomes prioritize value and try to get more for their money with bulk packs and private-label items.

As of Sept. 1, store traffic at Costco had increased 31% compared with the same period in pre-pandemic 2019, according to Placer.ai, an analytics company that estimates visits to locations based on smartphone data. 

Costco’s members are also getting younger. Those consumers prioritize health and wellness — and are willing to invest in it — in ways that older generations do not. 

About half of Costco’s new membership sign-ups last fiscal year came from people who were under 40 years old, and the average age of its 76 million members has fallen since the Covid-19 pandemic, Chief Financial Officer Gary Millerchip said on an earnings call in late September. 

According to Numerator, 36% of Costco’s customers have a household income of more than $125,000. Numerator has a panel of 150,000 U.S. consumers that is balanced to be representative of the country’s population.

Camp Sanders said Costco’s members “have the disposable income to be able to afford our premium products,” and their lifestyles align with what Peloton offers. 

“Many of Peloton’s members are affluent, they often have larger homes in the suburbs and they also have life situations where Peloton fits a clear need,” said Camp Sanders. “Many Costco members are juggling families, they maybe have a busy career … and they’ve got the space in their home” to build their own gyms, he continued. 

Costco’s Executive Vice President of Merchandising Claudine Adamo declined to comment to CNBC.

Peloton already sells its workout equipment through Amazon and Dick’s Sporting Goods, but has also been working to develop relationships with other companies that cater to similar customer bases. 

For example, hundreds of Hyatt Hotel properties have Peloton equipment on site. As of this month, hotel members can earn points for completing workouts on the Peloton Bike and Row during their stay. 

It also announced a deal with Truemed — the PayPal of the health savings account and flexible spending account world — that allows Peloton members to use pretax earnings to buy certain hardware products, including the Bike, Bike+ and Tread.

Title: Walmart will start delivering prescriptions as CVS and Walgreens struggle
Text
 As CVS and Walgreens shutter hundreds of stores nationwide to shore up profits and investor sentiment, Walmart said Tuesday that it is offering a new option for customers: Delivering prescriptions to their doorsteps.

The nation’s largest retailer said deliveries are now available in six states: Arkansas, Missouri, New York, Nevada, South Carolina and Wisconsin. The company said in a news release that it expects to deliver prescriptions in 49 states by the end of January. Prescription deliveries will not be available in North Dakota due to state laws, Walmart said.

The prescription delivery service is another example of how Walmart is trying to outmatch competitors on convenience along with low prices. With the new service, customers can get a mix of items dropped off during the same delivery, such as a box of tissues, blanket or chicken noodle soup.

Walmart’s new delivery offering could be another blow to drugstore chains, which are falling out of favor with consumers in a trend that has hit their profits and stock prices and forced them to reconsider their strategies. Still, it is unclear how much market share Walmart could win from CVS and Walgreens, both of which offer same-day, one-day and two-day prescription deliveries.

Tom Ward, chief e-commerce officer for Walmart U.S., said the company added pharmacy deliveries because of shopper demand.

“This is actually the number one service requested by our customers,” he said.

He said Walmart tested the deliveries in several states and saw that customers took advantage of getting a mix of items, including the prescription, in a single delivery.

Walmart’s delivery service will be available for new prescriptions and refills, the company said. It will cost $9.95 for a delivery, the standard price for Walmart doorstep deliveries, but will be free for members of Walmart+, the company’s membership program.

Health insurance plans will be applied to the transaction, like they would in the store, the company said.

The deliveries will come with a few more safety steps than Walmart’s other deliveries, the company said: Medications will be put into tamper-evident packaging. Customers can track orders in real time through Walmart’s app or website and get a photo in the app or by email when the prescription is delivered. And when a customer orders a new prescription and chooses delivery, they are prompted to do a consultation with the pharmacy by phone.

Most of Walmart’s annual revenue in the U.S. – nearly 60% – comes from groceries, but health and wellness is a growing category for the company, according to the retailer’s most recent annual filing for the fiscal year that ended Jan. 31. Health and wellness accounts for about 12% of its annual revenue in the U.S. It includes pharmacy, over-the-counter drugs and other medical products, optical services and other clinical services.

A new challenge for drugstores

As of Monday’s close, shares of Walmart were up around 54% for the year. Meanwhile, shares of CVS were down roughly 26% so far this year, while shares of Walgreens were down nearly 60%.

CVS is the top U.S. pharmacy in terms of prescription drug revenue, holding more than 25% of the market share in 2023, according to Statista data released in March. Walgreens trailed behind with nearly 15% of that share last year, while Walmart held just 5% of that share.

CVS and Walgreens are grappling with falling reimbursement rates for prescription drugs. Inflation, softer consumer spending and competition from Amazon, big-box retailers and grocery stores are making it difficult for them to turn a profit at the front of the store, which carries cleaning supplies, beauty products and pantry staples, among other items.

CVS CEO Karen Lynch left the company and was replaced by David Joyner last week, as CVS faces pressure from Wall Street and, more recently, an activist investor to turn around its business. On top of the leadership shakeup, CVS plans to cut $2 billion in expenses over several years. That includes slashing less than 1% of its workforce, or roughly 2,900 jobs, on the corporate side of its business.

The company is also wrapping up a three-year plan to close 900 of its stores, with 851 locations closed as of August.

Walgreens is similarly cutting costs, announcing last week that it will close roughly 1,200 stores over the next three years, which includes 500 in fiscal 2025 alone. The chain has around 8,700 locations in the U.S., a quarter of which it says are unprofitable.

Walmart has faced its own financial challenges on the health-care side of the business. The discounter planned to bring its low-price spin to health care by opening clinics that offered doctor, dentist and therapy appointments for less.

Yet in the spring, Walmart shuttered all of the clinics, saying in a news release at the time that it couldn’t operate a profitable business because of “the challenging reimbursement environment and escalating operating costs.”

Title: Other than revenue concerns, what kind of roadblock could RDDT face?
Text
 This is not a question about revenue or ads etc.
Overall bullish about RDDT.

 But still one needs to study the landscape and future potential roadblocks.

News Corp sued Perplexity the other day for basically copying parts of its articles (plagiarism) they claim.  

RDDT is not like Perplexity. But can provide data for it (or similar).

Could RDDT potentially get sued for selling data and some company like News Corp claim its theirs?

Or what about paywalled articles that are posted for free on some sub reddits.  Could RDDT be sued or fined for not tackling/preventing this issue?

Are the current users aware or checked off a disclaimer that their data may be sold to a 3rd party?

Any other potential roadblocks to be aware of?

Title: Thoughts on Walmart?
Text
 I'm considering picking up some shares but thought I'd see what the sub thinks.

Walmart's up 56% YTD which seems pretty astonishing for any retailer, let alone the largest company by revenue in the world.

Speaking of that revenue, it's grown from $524B in 2020 to $648B currently. P/E is 42 and EPS growth forecast according to Schwab for the 3-5 year horizon is 10.17%, which is higher than Costco and Target. 

Now they're moving into pharmaceutical delivery in an attempt to box out Walgreen's and CVS. It's a troublesome area, and WMT didn't fair well opening affordable health clinics, but does signal intent to continue growing revenue at a fast clip. 

Anecdotally, WMT seems like a great business. Their online and in-store shopping process has always been great IMO. I fondly remember my days in college going to the all night supercenter to find badly needed ping pong balls on a Saturday evening.

Any important facts or considerations I'm missing? Would love to see everyone else's POV.

Title: TLT too low to be ignored?
Text
 Just wanted to share some thoughs about yields and bonds that ive heard recently that caught my eye, maybe get some feedback or different ideas. This in the context of 10YR yields that went from **3.7%** to **4.2%** after the FED made the 50bps. The FEDs mandate, as you all know, is to balance employment and inflation.

**Employment:**

Some of the climb in yields comes from the idea that the economy is strong, with the unemployment rate climbing to 4.3% in July and then dropping since. A Bloomberg columnist wrote an interesting piece that talked about the idea that unemployment rate hasn’t peaked yet, due to 3 factors that played a key role in the September report.

1. Hiring in the education sector after an earlier delay
2. Outsized election spending
3. Responses to natural disasters

According to her, the drop from 4.22% to 4.05% in the unemployment rate was almost entirely driven by a 785k increase in government jobs (3.6 standard deviation move), which was the second largest monthly jump in government hiring since January 1990. Meanwhile, other Jobs fell 355k and as a result, total employment rose 430k net according to household data. Some possible explanations for the unusual increase in government hiring could be:

* The fast hiring in education, probably due to a later hiring schedule.
* A surge in hiring related to the presidential election — campaign-related activity saw an unusual increase in federal-level protective services in several swing states and Illinois — added 200,000 jobs, by their estimate.
* Emergency personnel related to reconstruction after damage by Hurricane Beryl and wildfires likely contributed about 100,000 jobs.

By their calculus, without the election cycle boost and the impact from natural disasters, the unemployment rate would have been 4.23%. Their conclusion is that those effects should persist in a lesser way in October but start reversing in December and expect a 4.5% by EOY.

**Inflation:**

Now let’s turn to the actual inflation data, the breakdown of the components of inflation ***~~(THERE SHOULD BE AN IMAGE HERE BUT THIS SUB DOESNT ALLOW GRAPHS AND STUFF).~~***

Services is the one big component that keeps pushing inflation higher, with Core Goods and energy contributing negatively to inflation (meaning they are showing lower prices now). What’s in the Services category? Well I have this table cause I got too lazy to make another graph: ***~~(THERE SHOULD BE A TABLE HERE TOO)~~***

Most of the inflation comes from Shelter, Medical Care Services and transportation services. Let’s talk about Shelter specifically. Everybody here knows that the housing market is nuts right now, there is not enough new supply to cover the demand, and the existing supply is locked due to the high mortgages. The idea here is basically that HIGHER INTEREST RATES WON’T alleviate this component, lower rates might help actually due to unlocking existing houses in the market.

Finally, last week we got retail sales that spooked some participants, but we already know that goods have been in negative territory for the last months so there shouldn’t be much problem there.

**Trade:**

Ive been shorting the TLT puts for a while, closed most of them when we got the 50 bps cut and then as we came down ive been adding. I did some of them too soon I think. Anyhow this are my positions:

* Long TLT shares
* Short Dec 20 puts, Strikes: $100, 95, 93, 90
* Short Nov 08 calls, $96.5 just to cover some of the long exposure

I think worst case I’d end up getting assigned a bunch of TLT into 2025 and going into the new year basically all in on TLT. I am getting worried tho because recently ive heard a lot of commentary about FED making a mistake with people like Stanley Druckenmiller shorting bonds with convincing arguments.

EDIT: I forgot something else, there is also the spread between the bond yields and earnings yields of the S&amp;P which is right now at historical extremes, basically saying its more attractive than stocks.

Title: Halliburton DD, Undervalued or value trap?
Text
 Hey there,  
I've been thinking of ways to profit off of potential war spiking oil up and Trump winning the election bext month. Obvious plays would be Oil or DJT respectively, but both are iffy at best. That's where I'd remembered that I've invested a few times into Halliburton $HAL, mostly swinging it for 20% and it's that time of the year again.

So what's their business? - Halliburton is one of the largest oil field service companies in the world. It provides a wide range of services and products to the energy industry, with a primary focus on oil and natural gas exploration, development, and production. Halliburton operates in over 70 countries and serves both national and independent oil and gas companies. I'll use ChatGPT to summarise the business underlying.

So what's my conviction? - You've got two ways to profit off of this business plus a large safety net in the form of a relative undervaluation. Technically speaking, the company is trading near the multi-years bottoms and the business has improved since.   
1st case: Drill baby, drill! - In case of Trump delivering on his promises to increase the rate of drilling, Halliburton profits, as it's literally their business

2nd case: Israel - Iran war breaking out - Oil is bound to increase in price as the risks increase and or the fields in the middle east get destroyed. In any case, since the company is in the Oil sector, it's bound to increase in price  
3rd case: None of these above happen - You've got a profitable, dividend paying company trading under the intrinsic value, that is projected to increase in price as per analysts' view - Lowest 52w target is still SIGNIFICANTLY above the current price

# Business breakdown (done using ChatGPT, please don't stone me)

1. **Completion and Production**
   * Services and products related to the completion of oil and gas wells, such as well cementing, stimulation (including hydraulic fracturing), and production enhancement.
   * Includes tools and systems that help improve oil and gas well output.
2. **Drilling and Evaluation**:
   * Provides services like directional drilling, well logging, and reservoir evaluation.
   * Offers technologies and services that help customers locate oil and gas reserves and understand reservoir characteristics.

# Major Services and Products:

* **Drilling Services**: Including equipment, tools, and techniques to drill and stabilize oil wells.
* **Hydraulic Fracturing**: A key service for extracting oil and natural gas from unconventional resources like shale.
* **Cementing**: Securing well integrity and preventing leaks between rock formations and drilled areas.
* **Artificial Lift**: Techniques and tools that help lift oil from the well to the surface when the reservoir pressure isn't sufficient.

I'm currently invested in at about 7.5% of my portfolio @ $28.3, ready to double down if it drops, as I trully believe this could be a good hedge againts war and possibly even major recession - Oil tends to get expensive

Please feel free to poke holes into my DD, I'd like to stir up a productive conversation below!

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help **measure the trajectory of a security.**  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **"priced in"**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

Title: Alphabet To $7 Trillion By 2025?
Text
 We believe Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) is positioned to grow its valuation by well over 3x from the already huge $2-trillion figure now – potentially becoming the world’s most valuable company by a huge margin – as its often-overlooked Waymo autonomous driving business quietly revolutionizes the transportation sector. This would take the stock to over $500 a share. Here’s why.

Fact: Waymo has grown the number of weekly paid rides from 10,000 to over 100,000 in the last 12 months. It went from 50,000 weekly rides to 100,000 just in the last six months.

The growth is compelling and the addressable market is massive

Case in point: Uber does more than 200 million rides each week. Let’s let that sink in. So if autonomous rides can capture even half that market, that would mean 100 million rides per week. That’s about 1,000 times where Waymo is today. 200 million rides a week translates to about a billion a month and over 10 billion a year. At $30 per ride, we’re talking revenues of close to $300 billion per year.

But wait… there is more to the growth story

If Waymo is already delivering over 100,000 driverless rides, how many more people might switch from driving their cars to being driven by autonomous vehicles? The shift could be massive. For each person hailing a cab, there are at least 10 others driving their own cars. Many of these drivers might reconsider once they see millions of people relaxing in the back seat, streaming Netflix, while they’re stuck behind the wheel.

In fact, early data backs this up. According to Earnest Analytics, Waymo is already retaining riders at a higher rate compared to other ride-hailing services like Uber or Lyft. People enjoy the experience of autonomous vehicles. Safety could also be another attraction. Waymo published a report last year indicating that its autonomous vehicles achieved an 85% reduction in injury-causing crashes compared to national rates for human-operated cars.

Investors will soon recognize that the $300 billion revenue figure for the current ride-hailing market has substantial growth potential – it could easily expand by 2-3x. A $1 trillion market for autonomous rides isn’t out of the question. This growth would also translate to significant revenue opportunities for automakers like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), which are working on their driverless vehicle technologies.

But wait aren’t so many automakers and tech players working on autonomous driving?

Yes, but not all of them are making the same progress. Waymo has a head start in the market. Its main competitor, General Motor’s backed Cruise lost its driverless permits in California after a serious accident, making Waymo the only publicly available robotaxi service in San Francisco. Uber exited its self-driving taxi program about six years ago and has partnered with Waymo to bring its services to the Uber app in some cities. While electric vehicle behemoth Tesla is seen as a leader of sorts in the self-driving space, given its large base of vehicles, it is only slowly getting into the space after the unveiling of its Robotaxi vehicle earlier this month.

Waymo has some advantages in terms of tech as well. It uses a fleet equipped with high-resolution cameras, LiDAR, and radar systems, creating a comprehensive view of its surroundings. And don’t forget Google’s got a secret weapon. It crowdsources annotated data such as CAPTCHA codes from its massive user base, using that to train its machine-learning models. That’s a big advantage in terms of understanding complex driving environments.

The best part?

These are self-driving cars – no human drivers, no unions, no employee or contractor issues, and no human cost. While there will be other expenses, such as software development and battery costs, the absence of driver wages could lead to exceptionally high margins. Margins of 50% aren’t unrealistic when you consider that driver earnings account for a substantial portion of gross fares in traditional ride-hailing models.

If Waymo can capture about one-third of the $1 trillion autonomous rides market, it could generate annual revenues of around $300 billion. With a 50% margin, that’s a neat $150 billion in profits. What’s that worth? At a 30x earnings multiple, that would imply an additional valuation of about $4.5 trillion for Alphabet. Considering that Alphabet is worth roughly $2 trillion presently, this could take the company’s market cap to over $6.5 trillion, or over $500 per share.

To be sure, building this sort of scale can take a good deal of time – quite different from signing up for say a Google or Netflix account. However, investors will need to look well out into the future. Think 2030 (not 2025), maybe even more. The point is not to get stuck – if you’re concerned, look even further out, say 2035! The bottom line: Alphabet is growing Waymo quickly, has the technology and competitive edge, and is addressing a potentially massive market, making this high valuation within reach.

Title: 10-year Treasury yield jumps as investors monitor Fed speeches
Text
 It would be interesting to see that 10-year Treasury yield keeps going up when Fed starts to cut interest rates in September 2024 ... something went wrong very probably \~

&amp;#x200B;

**10-year Treasury yield jumps as investors monitor Fed speeches**

[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/21/us-bonds-10-year-treasury-yield-in-focus-amid-flurry-of-fed-speeches.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/21/us-bonds-10-year-treasury-yield-in-focus-amid-flurry-of-fed-speeches.html)

&amp;#x200B;

*The U.S. 10-year Treasury yield jumped on Monday as investors digest a flurry of speeches from Federal Reserve policymakers.*
  

  
*The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose more than 9 basis points to 4.172 %. The yield on the 2-year Treasury was up about 7 basis points to 4.025%.*
  

  
*Yields and prices move in opposite directions. One basis point equals 0.01%.*
  

  
*On a day without any major economic data releases, market participants are likely to scrutinize comments from officials at the U.S. central bank.*
  

  
*Dallas Federal Reserve President Lorie Logan said Monday she supports the current move to lowering interest rates, but that a patient approach will be needed.*
  

  
*“If the economy evolves as I currently expect, a strategy of gradually lowering the policy rate toward a more normal or neutral level can help manage the risks and achieve our goals,” Logan said during a speech in New York. “However, any number of shocks could influence what that path to normal will look like, how fast policy should move and where rates should settle. In my view, the \[Federal Open Market Committee\] will need to remain nimble and willing to adjust if appropriate.”*
  

  
*Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari, Kansas City Fed President Jeff Schmid and San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly are also delivering remarks on Monday.*
  

  
*The Federal Open Market Committee took the unusual step last month of lowering its baseline interest rate by a half percentage point, or 50 basis points, to a target range of 4.75% to 5%.*

Title: What does it mean when the stock price rises, while the short interest rises alongside it?
Text
 In the case of the stock CompoSecure (CMPO) ([info](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/cmpo)), I have the following data:


Date, Stock price, short interest, % of float:
- 06/28, $6.8,              4MM, 15.5%
- 07/15, $7.67,              4.5MM, 17.5%
- 07/31, $8.15,             5.4MM, 21%
- 08/15, $11.02,           8.2MM, 31.9%
- 08/30, $11.73,          10.1MM, 39.2%
- 09/13, $12.39,          10.8MM, 42%
- 09/30, $14.02,          13MM, 50.5%

As you can see not only has the stock price increased dramatically but so has the short interest ([Nasdaq data](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/cmpo/short-interest)). Any possible explanation for this? What I’ve seen in the past is that if a stock has a high short interest, and the price gradually rises, typically, you’d see the short interest trend downward. However, it seems like the opposite is true for CMPO.

Any wrinkle brains willing to give an explanation?

Title: Disney will name new CEO in early 2026; Gorman to become board chair next year
Text
 Disney has tapped James Gorman to replace Mark Parker as the company’s next chairman, effective in January, as the media giant lays the groundwork to name a successor for CEO Bob Iger in early 2026, the company said Monday.

Gorman joined Disney’s board less than a year ago and was named the head of the succession planning committee in August. He will continue to lead that committee after he takes over as board chairman from Nike Executive Chairman Parker.

“The Disney board has benefited tremendously from James Gorman’s expertise and guidance, and we are lucky to have him as our next chairman – particularly as the board continues to move forward with the succession process,” Iger said in a statement. “I’m extremely grateful to Mark Parker for his many years of board service and leadership, which have been so valuable to this company and its shareholders, and to me as CEO.”

Parker will step down after nine years on the Disney board “to focus on other areas” of his work, according to a Disney statement. That includes spending more time working on Nike-related matters, according to a person familiar with the matter. Elliott Hill took over as Nike CEO last week, replacing John Donahoe.

Early 2026

Disney had initially targeted 2025 to announce a successor, as CNBC reported last year. Pushing the date back to early 2026 will give the board more time to conduct due diligence on both internal and external candidates, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because the discussions are private.

Gorman has experience with succession planning: He oversaw the orderly transfer of power at Morgan Stanley, with Ted Pick succeeding him as CEO there at the start of this year.

Succession hasn’t been smooth at Disney. The board fired Iger’s handpicked successor, Bob Chapek, in November 2022 after a turbulent tenure that lasted less than three years. Iger returned to the CEO job, and now, Disney shareholders are eager to see a succession plan stick.

Iger’s four direct reports — ESPN Chairman Jimmy Pitaro, Disney Experiences Chairman Josh D’Amaro, and Disney Entertainment Co-Chairmen Dana Walden and Alan Bergman — have all interviewed with the succession committee in recent weeks, since Gorman took over in August, according to the people familiar.

Gorman said in a CNBC interview in March, before taking over as the board’s succession chair, that Disney was running a “forward-looking, forward-leaning, incredibly disciplined process.”

Still, while putting a specific timeline on naming a successor adds a bit of clarity to the search, it also means the question of who will take over for Iger will continue to hover over the company for another year.

Iger has pushed back his retirement five different times to continue to lead Disney as CEO. Activist investor Nelson Peltz focused on the board’s failure to name a lasting successor in his unsuccessful campaign to gain board seats earlier this year.

Iger’s current contract as CEO runs until Dec. 31, 2026. He and the board haven’t decided if Iger will extend his board tenure past 2026, said the people familiar.

 I hold a stock and want to play some of the volatility.  Whats stopping me from selling when it pops 20%-30% and buying back in a couple days later if the price drops back down?

Title: Would I be paying more taxes and losing more money withdrawing profits from stocks vs just keeping Salary? 
Text
 I want to invest a lot of my salary into stocks to make more money. But if I withdraw profits  from stock, I have to pay more taxes. Would the taxes on my salary and my stock profits actually just make me lose more money or equate to even amount, if I hadn’t just invested at all? 
For example, let’s say I make $2000 a month salary. Then let’s say I profit $2000 from a stock a month. Would this actually make me lose more money paying double taxes? Or would this just make me even, meaning no difference if I had just kept my salary and never invested.

Title: AI ETF's or VGT/QQQ?
Text
 Are there any good etfs dedicated to AI or is it a better idea to invest in technology focused ETFs such as VGT or QQQ?

I purchased a few shares of SMH but it is more focused on the hardware aspect of AI. Also, it went down after I have purchased and I have been in the negative for quite some time. So I am not very hopeful about it and hence looking at AI ETF's specifically focused on the software side like OPEN AI, perplexity etc.

Title: Big Share Growth Potential with Low P/E and High EPS Projection: Golden Entertainment (GDEN)
Text
 Disclosure: I own both stock and calls for GDEN that I plan on holding past the earnings on 11/7.  Do your own research too!

TLDR: P/E ratio significantly lower than industry average (3.3 vs. &gt;15), favorable foot-traffic and occupancy data, Marketbeat predicts over $500 earnings growth over the next year

Golden Entertainment (NASDAQ: GDEN) offers a compelling opportunity for value investors, thanks to its attractive valuation, strategic growth, and improving foot traffic trends. Here’s why GDEN deserves a closer look.

**Key Fundamentals and Considerations**

1. **Valuation:**
   * **P/E Ratio:** 3.35 (vs. sector peers like Sands at 24, MGM at 15 and Wynn at 13). This suggests GDEN is deeply undervalued compared to the market​
2. **Improving Hotel Performance:**
   * **STRAT Hotel and Casino** achieved **record revenue** in Q2 2024.
   * **ADR increased by 8%**, with **occupancy rising 4%** YoY to 73%.
   * Weekend occupancy hit an impressive **97%**, while midweek occupancy improved to **64%**, demonstrating growing visitor traffic
3. **Earnings Call on November 7, 2024:**
   * With a projected **516% EPS increase** over the next year, the upcoming earnings call could trigger significant upside. (Marketbeat)

**Risks to Monitor**

* **Insider Sales:** Recent sales by insiders reflect cautious profit-taking but not necessarily a lack of confidence, as insiders still retain significant holdings​
* **Sector Volatility:** While improving, hospitality and gaming sectors remain sensitive to macroeconomic conditions.

**Conclusion:** potential high value play with growth potential

Golden Entertainment’s rising foot traffic, particularly at the STRAT, coupled with its undervaluation, makes it an intriguing investment. With growing momentum in its core Nevada operations and expansion in tavern locations, GDEN offers a promising blend of growth and value.

Title: Buying stocks in a malarkey market
Text
 This may be a no shit Sherlock observation but sitting on cash and waiting (waiting, waiting, and waiting) for a particular stock to crash because of scandal or sour sentiment seems to be the way. I used to pick stocks based on long term value, fundamentals, and sometimes FOMO hype but my returns were middling. The past year or so I've waited for bad news to wreck a stock because it doesn't seem like there's any long term punishment for these companies. I watched CRWD take a dive after a scandal, bought at $217. I watched SMCI drop on a scandal, bought at $39. SAVA faceplanted on a scandal, bought at $12. ASTS at $3, PI at $49, BABA at $81, etc... Now I'm making money all of a suddenly. Is this a good strategy or have I just gotten lucky lately? Because I still hesitate now and then. SNOW, for instance, dropped to $110 and INTC to under $20 and I have NOT pulled the trigger for whatever reason.

Title: ALT  Obesity, hype is not over.   Upside enormous 
Text
 Obesity stock. Altimmune  management has continuously stated: **We want a partner at the Phase 3 Trial design meeting with the FDA**

Meeting, as per PR, early November. Therefore, a partner anticipated to be announce any day now. Though, to be honest - we have been waiting for a year now. Altimmune, unlike others, is in advanced stages and has FAST TRACK STATUS.

If this comes true, retail can sit in a warm bath together with Sexy Institutions and Shorts.

* Float 71 million
* Institutional ownership 63%, 43 million
* Short 31%, 22 million
   * **Do the math: Retail left-overs?**
      * No dilution expected, 150 million in the bank.

What does a Obesity play getting a trial fully funded looks like?

[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VKTX/](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VKTX/)

If partner announced, see beginning of chart (10$-30$). If additional data announced, see trajectory from Feb onward (30$ - 90$)

* *Lean Loss Ratio of only 21.9%, representing class-leading preservation of lean mass*
* *Maintenance of lean mass preservation in individuals over the age of 60, a population at risk for frailty-related falls and fractures*
* *Visceral adipose tissue (VAT), a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, reduced by 28.3% at Week 48*

===============================

A bit of DD mixed with opinion:

1. **Why $ALT over $VKTX?**
   * VKTX-2735 &lt; PEMVI 2.4mg -- PEMVI superior quality of Weight Loss as measured by % FAT vs. % LEAN reduction (i.e. the KEY next-gen GLP1 metric)
   * PEMVI broad CARDIOVASCULAR activity/potential
   * PEMVI MOA includes Thermogenic/RMR component for LT use
   * PEMVI body recomp. potential via class-leading lean muscle preservation
   * PEMVI P3 titration/DR design to 'fix' outlier 48wk P2 (other PEMVI studies have shown tolerability on par with VK2735)
   * VK2735 is faster WL which is better for BMI 40+ class 3 Obesity (smaller market), but not for avg. person -- VK to compete with $LLY Zep,
   * PEMVI is SIGNIFICANTLY differentiated high quality Next-gen GLP1 WL
   * VKTX-2809 &lt; PEMVI 1.8mg -- PEMVI rapid liver defatting in 6-12 wks (MASLD)
   * PEMVI better 24wk anti-fibrotic potential vs 52wk VKTX
   * PEMVI bypasses thyroid and is leading GLP1 liver MOA
2. **Why is Viking valued at 50$ and Altimmune at 6$?**
   * Viking Management simply is better at managing their stock. Viking has 900 million in cash, which they simply raised in a brilliant way.
   * Altimmune had a short report to endure, in which Kerrisdale stupidly rehashed old data, BUT Altimmune management FAILED at protecting the stock they let Jefferies do their bidding.
   * Altimmune cash runway 150 million (or so), they stupidly ran the ATM at the absolute wrong moment.
3. **But why is Altimmune still the better stock?**
   * Pemvi as explained above, is smarter. Not Obesity, but curative fatty liver - COVERED BY INSURANCE ALREADY. Which pure obesity drugs are not, like Zepbound Wegovy
   * Altimmune has FAST TRACK status. A nugget overseen by many
   * Altimmune has a much much larger upside, at this moment. The odds of Viking crashing, extremely high. They are a Bio, they will face a setback. I believe if Viking was to be bought now, it would be at 100$ per share
   * If Altimmune was to be bought now, 40$-75$ per share would be fair.
   * If Altimmune announces a partner, it will likely be a 20$ 30$ stock within days.

With the advancements of AI, they are bound to create some cool technology, and they got hit pretty hard over the past year. I think a comeback is inevitable. Being far from it’s all time high, I think it’s the most obvious purchase in the stock market now.

Title: What happens when the 10year 3month yield curve un-inverts? 
Text
 September 23rd was at -.89% today October 21st it’s at -.47%. 
  
Another 30 days approx if that, it will definitely go positive. 
  
Then we will find out if it this time is different. 
  
I find it funny that the Fed started cutting rates on September 18th 2024, they also started cutting rates on September 18th 2007….. by .50 basis points both times. 
  
If this isn’t cynical foreshadowing then I don’t know what is.

Title: Ripe for picking - (FDMT) 4D Molecular Therapeutics?
Text
 Their current pipeline focus "4D-150" is for treatment of Neovascular (Wet) Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD).

FDMT current market cap $443.30M

1. **Potential Market:**
   - 20 million US citizens aged 40 and older have AMD, with 200,000 new cases added each year.
   - 10-15% are Wet AMD, so 2-3 million affected.
   - Current treatment involves Anti-VEGF shots into the eye every 4-12 weeks (lifelong treatment, no cure).
   - Latest 4D-150 Phase 2 results show "83% overall reduction in annualized injections through 52 weeks" and "70% injection-free through 52 weeks".
   - It's RNA-based, so shots will need to be repeated eventually.
   - Current anti-VEGF treatment costs $13,875 to $24,000 per person annually.
   - Conservative estimate: 4D-150 priced at $15,000 per shot (likely 2-3x higher as it's gene therapy), capturing 20% of 2 million market = 400,000 patients.
   - **Potential annual revenue: $6 billion (400,000 * $15,000)**
   - Global anti-VEGF market: $12.3 billion in 2022, estimated $13.7 billion by 2031.
   - If 4D-150 captures 20% of that: $2.46 billion annually.
   - **Potential market cap: $7.38 billion (3x revenue)** - a 1463% increase from current value (assuming successful Phase 3 and market entry). Assuming it will take 3-5 years for the drug to hit the market, we are looking at 300%-500% annual yield.

2. **Safety:** "Comparable to approved anti-VEGF agents", suggesting likely Phase 3 success and market entry.

3. **Competition:**
   - Currently, no gene therapy drugs for AMD are on the market.
   - 23 gene therapy studies for AMD are in various stages of clinical trials.
   - Among these studies, only three companies are listed on NASDAQ:
   - FDMT, ADVM, RGNX
   - All at similar stages with comparable results (FDMT results slightly better (look at the "Reduction in Annualized Anti-VEGF Injections")).

4. **Finances:**
   - FDMT has $541.95M cash, sufficient until 2030 (based on current FCF of -$87.17M)
   - Competitors have 1.5-2 years of cash, likely facing dilution
   - FDMT's market cap should be way higher when compared to those direct competitors (imo).

5. **Stock Performance Paradox:**

Despite consistently positive results, FDMT's stock has experienced a significant decline. Here's a breakdown of the situation:

- Since February 5th presentation which lead to a huge upward spike, FDMT has released two additional analyses of their 4D-150 drug:
  - July 17 presentation
  - September 18 presentation
  - Both show even better numbers than the February results

**Potential Explanation for low stock price: Heavy Shorting**

- [This graph](https://i.imgur.com/xE0EjSx.jpeg) combines data from NASDAQ and StockAnalysis.com
- Between July 13-17 (after 2nd presentation release):
  - Short interest dropped from 10.3M to 9.5M
  - Spike in average daily share volume
- Interpretation: Short sellers likely closed positions after seeing good results, driving the price down

**Unexpected Consequence:**

- This triggered an investigation:
  &gt; "The investigation focuses on whether the Company issued false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose information pertinent to investors. 4D Molecular Therapeutics released the interim results of its Phase 2 PRISM study on Intravitreal 4D-150 on July 17, 2024. Despite the Company billing the results as positive, the stock fell by more than 35.8% in afternoon trading on the same day."

- In my opinion, the current situation isn't related to securities fraud, but rather reflects the inherent volatility of the biotech market. However, the mere mention of 'securities fraud' has negatively impacted the company's stock profile, leading to further declines. This has been exacerbated by repeated dissemination of this news on Accesswire since July.
Consequently, short interest has increased significantly, currently **41.39%** of the float is shorted with a 7-day cover period. This level of short interest seems **CRAZY** for a promising pre-revenue biotech stock and suggests the potential for a short squ-eeze.
While the timing is uncertain, the combination of high short interest and extended cover period indicates a likelihood of future price increases.

**TLDR**: FDMT shows strong potential in AMD treatment with better financials than competitors. Current stock price seems undervalued, possibly due to shorting. High short interest suggests potential for a squee-ze raising the current price substantially.

What are your thoughts? Am I missing any crucial points?

EDIT: I haven't started a position yet, this post is like a sanity check.

Title: Are there any stocks you will never buy because they don't align with your values?  What are they?  If you want to share, why not?
Text
 For moral, ethical, religions etc reasons, is there a company's stock you will never buy, no matter how good the financial return.  For example, some people  say " I would never buy Dos Amigos Enterprises (fictional name) shares because they use Mexican slave labor to make their Tequila".

If so, why won't you buy it?

EDIT:  Let's have an open discussion.

Title: How dumb would it be to invest a large sum of money (90k) into, individual, "safe" stocks instead of in VOO?
Text
 essentially the title. I have about 90k sitting in my vanguard brokerage already invested in VOO. My work 401k &amp; personal Roth IRA are already invested in S&amp;P 500 funds. I am 32 and want to take on some risk (hoping to retire in my late 50s). The funds I was looking at throwing the money at, would be in some combination of NVDA, MSFT, GOOG, and AMZN - in no specific order. In terms of an investment horizon, I was thinking DCA these funds over the next 10 years. While I'm aware there is no such thing as a safe stock, I feel like I could at least make some money over the next decade with these (or *hopefully* beat the S&amp;P average return - if only by a little) stocks, as they are "generally" safe over time - a statement I use very loosely and realize the flaw in using historical averages to predict future ones. Would doing this be stupid, and should I continue holding the funds in VOO, or is this plan not the worst idea?

Title: I spent some time reading again on SMCI and I wonder why didn't SMCI sue Hindenburg for falsehood
Text
 That is if it is really falsehood by Hindenburg which SMCI is convinced of. Granted SMCI did have some shoddy track records in the past. What is most concerning to me is former employee and whistleblower Bob Luong filing a lawsuit against SMCI. This is one man against a large cap sized company.

I like SMCI but the lawsuit by Bob Luong just feels like an abatross around the neck.

Title: Where do you keep your money in between buying opportunities?
Text
 Assuming a brokerage account...

You bought a stock that you liked, and saw some significant gains. Over time, the stock climbed to a level that now feels inflated. You can't see the stock maintaining this level for very long. You cash out and pocket the gains.

Now, you have cash in your brokerage account. Do you leave it in cash until you find another buying opportunity? Do you put it into an ETF, and cash out again when needed?

Title: Trying to Decide Between Public.com and Charles Schwab

I'm looking at two platforms, Public.com and Charles Schwab. I only have a little experience with Charles Scwahb and haven't looked at any other platform before. But I've seen some good things about public too. Especially considering their seemingly better user interface.

Curious what y'all think and recommend for me.

 Man google is basically like 80% of my portfolio and i’ve kept hearing negativity surrounding it (regulatory risk, search &amp; ads business at risk, managerial issues..etc).

Title: Why do you guys even bother trading when you can just buy the S&amp;P 500?
Text
 I’m genuinely curious. I’m not trying to dog on any of yall. I’m sure some of you have made a lot of money on individual stocks.

But like… I struggle to understand why you guys even bother. I just don’t see a point in investing in single company stocks.

They’re too volatile, companies change, etc. for instance Cisco used to practically be a monopoly. Now I’m not even sure it’ll reach the ATH from 20 years ago… ever. 

Also all of the time invested. Time is money… you really gotta research a lot before even considering buying stocks. 

So why not just go S&amp;P 500, bonds, 401k, etc. it’s going great for me (130k net worth at 25.) 

Just curious, thanks.

Title: Anyone getting AMZN at these levels?
Text
 Hey all, just curious if anyone is buying Amazon (AMZN) right now? The stock’s been dipping a bit, and I’m wondering if this is a good entry point for the long term or if there’s more downside coming. Thoughts on where it’s headed or just holding off for now? Would love to hear what you guys think!

Title: Looking to dump some stocks before the end of the year specifically RIVN. Looking for insight, please.
Text
 As title states, currently holding RIVN and it is down about 66% since I purchased it. It's sitting at just over $10 a share. I was holding onto it hoping that the likely booming EV market would include RIVN, but doesn't appear to be the case for a variety of reasons.

So, just curious as to what others think. 

I'm definitely a novice, but have had an etrade account since 2020 and have experienced a decent overall return. 

RIVN is currently on the chopping block. 

Please and thanks.

Title: Does anyone here collect old stock certificates? Or is there a market for these?
Text
 My Dad recently passed and I found a huge file with old stock certificates that my grandfather and his cousin owned.  

Most are dated from the late 1920's.  They are all defunct companies like Durant Motors, Big Yellow Taxi Company, etc.  

I'd love to sell them if they are worth anything - obviously, the stock is no longer worth anything - just didn't know if the actual certificates might be.

Title: Are there any stocks you will always buy because they align with your values? What are they? If you want to share, why not?

 There was a post that asked the question in the negative, it was a great question, but I thought that the opposite question should be asked. Are there stocks that you feel are worth your investment? Stocks you won't invest in is important, but which stocks do you feel align with your values?

If you are willing to share those stocks, what is it about them that aligns with your values?

BTW, credit to the original poster of the opposite question:

Title: Nebius set to resume Nasdaq trading after completing split from Russia’s Yandex
Text
 Oct 17 (Reuters) - AI infrastructure firm Nebius Group (NBIS.O), opens new tab said on Thursday its shares will resume Nasdaq trading on Monday after being halted following Russia's February 2022 invasion of Ukraine.
At that time, the stock traded under the ticker of Russian internet giant Yandex through its Amsterdam-based parent company.
In July, a Russian consortium finalized a $5.4 billion deal to acquire the Russia-based assets of Yandex, a move that marked the largest corporate exit since the invasion.

"We are pleased to have our shares trading again on Nasdaq, which opens a new chapter for our company as a publicly traded pure play in the fast-growing AI infrastructure space," Nebius CEO Arkady Volozh said.
Other Russian companies were suspended and ultimately delisted from Nasdaq, but Nebius maintained a suspended listing during months of negotiations to secure an exit from Russia, provided it could decouple from Yandex.

Many of the same Western shareholders have stakes in Nebius, but the company has undergone a significant transformation.
Once valued at over $30 billion as Russia's equivalent of Google, Nebius is now a fledgling European tech company focused on AI infrastructure, cloud services, and self-driving technology.
AI-FOCUSED

With its Russian ties severed, Nebius is strategically positioning itself to capitalize on the burgeoning AI market, founder and CEO Arkady Volozh told Reuters in July. Nebius plans to invest more than $1 billion by mid-2025.b

"Our ambition is to build one of the world's largest specialist AI infrastructure businesses. This requires access to technological expertise, graphics processing units ("GPUs") and capital. These are exactly what we have", Volozh said.
Nebius had annualized run-rate revenue of $120 million as of September 30, 2024, and it expects to be on track for $170 million to $190 million in annualized run-rate revenue by year end 2024, the statement said.

Nebius Group N.V. (“Nebius Group” or the “Company”; NASDAQ: NBIS) today announces that it has been informed by The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) that trading in the Company's Class A ordinary shares is scheduled to resume on Monday October 21, 2024.

Title: Games Workshop - Hold or Sell?
Text
 In late August I bought €450 of Games Workshop stock.  
For those who don't know, Games Workshop (GW) is a hobby shop based in the UK but with stores across a range of countries in Europe, NA, the Commonwealth and China. The shop is most famous as the designers and producers of the Warhammer franchise.

Typically when I invest I just put money in funds because I don't think I can generally do a better job than professional traders. In this case, I came to the conclusion that the stock was undervalued for two reasons. (1) The stores had returned very healthy growth in the 2023/2024 financial year, including a healthy uptake in footfall (2) the market had underappreciated the impact of the Space Marine 2 game, set to come out in September, on future GW revenue. I'd seen some gameplay footage back in maybe July and was quite confident it was going to be a hit.

My plan was to buy the stock, hold until the half-year report in January and sell if I'm in profit.

Well it looks like I was right...   
GW have capitalized on the success of Space Marine 2 by selling a tie-in starter set.   
These have been selling like hot cakes according to folks I know who work in stores.  
Web chatter seems to agree that footfall is up.  
The markets seem to agree and the stock price has risen about 12% in a month.

All sounds good, right?   
I should stick to my original plan, hold till the January report and then sell when good sales figures buoy the stock price.

The big question mark, however, is an ongoing deal (or lack thereof) with Amazon to produce a small-screen Warhammer 40K series with Henry Cavill as the creative director. Cavill, for reference, is a long-time fan of the IP and is widely expected to do a good job, if a deal were to come through. However, the project has been under a degree of uncertainty following the general contraction of the streaming industry and GW have put a limit of the end of the year to come to a deal, or they're pulling the plug.

Obviously, if the TV show is announced, it could drive the stock price nice and high.  
But if the deal falls through, I'm concerned that this could set the stock back and offset the gains I've made.

So what do you all think?  
(1) Sell now. Bank a nice little return.  
(2) Hold till the January report and hope that there's good news on the Amazon deal, and/or a good half-year report.

Title: Netflix third-quarter subscribers barely beat estimates as ad-tier members jump 35%

 Netflix posted third-quarter earnings that beat on the top and bottom line Thursday after the bell.

The company’s advertising business continued to grow in the third-quarter, with ad-tier memberships jumping 35% quarter-over-quarter. It’s on track to launch this service in Canada in the coming quarter and more broadly in 2025.

Here are the results:

Earnings per share: $5.40 compared with the $5.12 expected by LSEG.

Revenue: $9.83 billion compared with the $9.77 billion expected by LSEG.

Paid memberships: 282.7 million compared to 282.15 million expected, according to StreetAccount

Title: Investing $140k
Text
 My wife has student loans of 200k. We just came into 140k cash from a good deal, but this is pretty much all the savings we have, outside of my 401k and an emergency stash. 

Hey student loans aren’t generating interest atm., just sitting. 

I am thinking to put it all into VTSAX, and pull it out when it gets to 200k to pay them, or when something changes and her loans will start accruing interest again. 

Obviously ideally I’d make bank on stock market and loans wouldn’t accrue interest for a long while etc etc. so there’s money left over after repayment. But I want to be very realistic and careful as loosing that chunk would obviously put us back to square one. 

What do you think of this strategy and are there options I am missing? 

Edit: 1) for context we have 3 kids and a happy marriage. Not considering her leaving after loan is payed, for better or worse. 2) I am asking for advice and not committed to doing this. Just paying off the loan is where we started but we feel that having this chunk can be an opportunity so we want to ensure we talk through all the option and consider the risk for each.

Title: Fickle on China
Text
 I'm fickle over China/KWEB. Their stock market is pretty much an on/off switch unlike the US. And they appear to be turning it on again, but it's hard to trust them. They are socialist, authoritarian, but also capitalist society. Singapore is a better and less corrupt version of it, and the economic results are good. So the economics will work out in China as they use immigration to offset population decline. And I'm cool with the VIE structure because the American listed shares don't trade at a discount to the HK listed shares. I just don't trust authority when it has this much power. 

How do I get through that bias to see if the opportunity is real this time?

Title: Google CEO names new search and ads boss, slides predecessor to chief technologist
Text
 Google is replacing Prabhakar Raghavan, the company’s search and ads boss, with longtime Google executive Nick Fox.

The move was announced by Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai, who said in a blog post on Thursday that Raghavan will be moving into the role of chief technologist after 12 years of leading teams across the search company. Raghavan will continue to report to Pichai in the new role, the company told CNBC in a statement.

“Prabhakar has decided it’s time to make a big leap in his own career,” Pichai wrote in the post. “In this role, he’ll partner closely with me and Google leads to provide technical direction and leadership and grow our culture of tech excellence.”

The move comes as Google continues to restructure its teams to move more quickly in the artificial intelligence arms race, where it faces increased competition. The company is also dealing with several antitrust lawsuits related to its search and ads business.

Fox has long been a member of Raghavan’s leadership team. He will be leading Google’s Knowledge and Information division, which includes the company’s search, ads and commerce products, Pichai said.

A Google employee since 2003, Fox has been vice president for product and design for the company’s Assistant product in recent years. He previously worked within the company’s ads business unit.

“Over the past few years, Nick has been instrumental in shaping Google’s AI product roadmap and collaborating closely with Prabhakar,” Pichai wrote.

Raghavan led the knowledge and information unit since 2018. Earlier this year, he told employees to prepare for a different market reality because “things are not like they were 15-20 years ago,” CNBC reported.

Additionally, Pichai announced that the team working on Google’s Gemini app, which includes Google’s AI direct-to-consumer products, will join Google DeepMind under AI head Demis Hassabis.

“Bringing the teams closer together will improve feedback loops, enable fast deployment of our new models in the Gemini app,” Pichai wrote.

The move also means the Assistant teams focused on devices and home experiences will move to the Platforms and Devices unit “so they can sit closer to the product surfaces they’re building for,” Pichai wrote.

Title: Intel seeks billions for minority stake in Altera business, sources say
Text
 Intel is looking to sell at least a minority stake in its Altera subsidiary that would raise several billion dollars in cash for the struggling firm, according to people familiar with the matter. This move that would represent a sharp about face from its earlier public messaging about the larger company’s prospects.

The storied semiconductor firm has made overtures to a number of private equity and strategic investors this week, said the people, who requested anonymity to speak freely about confidential information. Intel has expressed to some of those investors that it would be possible to acquire a majority stake in the Altera business, which was valued at $16.7 billion when Intel acquired it in 2015, said one of the people.

Intel is looking for a deal that values Altera at around $17 billion, said the people.

A representative for Intel did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment. The sale process represents an abrupt about-face from Intel’s prior commentary on Altera, where as recently September its CEO said that Intel’s leadership considered the business to be a core part of Intel’s future.

Intel has previously said that it could look to monetize its Altera business via an initial public offering, possibly as soon as 2026. But the idea of taking strategic or private equity investment would be a marked acceleration of those plans.

CEO Pat Gelsinger and his leadership team have previously said that Intel understands its disadvantaged position and is working aggressively to remedy it. To be sure, the sale of a minority stake in Altera would allow Intel to more easily pursue its semiconductor fabrication ambitions and assuage investors that it has a strong path forward as an independent company.

But the sale process also comes as Qualcomm has expressed interest in acquiring its onetime rival, a deal which would face fierce regulatory scrutiny and reshape semiconductor industry. Intel has to grapple with a significant debt load, and has seen its stock plunge more than 50% year-to-date.

Title: Is a gamestop scenario happening in China right now？
Text
 JD.com (HKG: 9618, NASDAQ: JD), a Chinese e-commerce platform specializing in electronics and premium products, is well-known for its responsive customer support. However, the company has recently gained attention due to a controversial endorsement event by Yang Li, a talk show host known for her misandrist rhetoric and numerous remarks against geeks. Yang's involvement has previously been linked to significant stock price declines for other companies (e.g., 600702.SH, SHA: 600398, and others) that featured her in commercials or as a spokesperson.

Amidst ongoing heated gender debates in China, many of JD's male customers have mobilized through social media to express their discontent. Early actions included calls for JD Plus membership refunds and requests for VAT invoices on past purchases. To date, there have been over 300,000 posts across various social media platforms discussing this issue.

As of yesterday, netizens have escalated their response, withdrawing funds from JD-affiliated investment products and short-term funds. They have also advocated for using JD's lending services to withdraw as much money as possible within the one-month interest-free period, effectively triggering fears of a "run" on JD’s financial services. In response, [JD.com](http://JD.com) attempted to mitigate concerns by sending text messages to its financial service users, denying the existence of a run. Ironically, this only fueled further withdrawals, as people feared the situation was real.

Additionally, some users reported that certain JD Finance fund accounts had restricted redemptions, with payment accounts shifting from JD to liquidity borrowing accounts at China Industrial Bank. As of today, reports indicate that Industrial Bank's short-term liquidity funds have been depleted, prompting a further shift of payment accounts to Ping An Bank.

There was a 12% decline in JD's stock following the announcement of Yang Li as the spokesperson for their event. While there was a brief recovery on the 18th after JD issued an apology, many netizens deemed the apology insincere and continued to call for further action over the weekend.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS &amp; revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

 I currently hold XEQT for the majority of my portfolio and some HXQ. I’m looking to dive deeper into the tech industry, but I want to avoid the big 7 stocks as I already have that through HXQ. I found the semiconductor ETFs to be a good technology niche with great growth potential, due to the high demand and usage of semiconductors.

I don't want to sell to use the cash, I want to keep in the stock, but I don't know if I need to sell and buy again or keep it growing or like its right now

The Stock is a strong stock and is expected to grow more, but I hear ppl say that I need to take part of the profit and then reinvest it again. other say, just leave it and don't think about it.

whats your advice about these 2 ideas?

Title: Uber has discussed a bid for travel booking company Expedia
Text
 Uber discussed a bid for travel booking company Expedia, CNBC confirmed, in a deal that would push the ride-share company into new markets beyond car travel and food delivery.

The talks were in early stages, according to a person familiar with the discussions who asked not to be named since the talks are confidential. It remains unclear if an acquisition will take place. Expedia is familiar territory for Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, who previously served as CEO of the travel group from 2005 to 2017. Khosrowshahi is still a non-executive member of Expedia’s board.

Uber has a market cap of around $168 billion, greater than its pandemic peak of around $112 billion, when customers were trapped indoors and relied on food deliveries. Shares fell in 2022 as the company struggled with high gas prices, inflation and bringing more drivers back to the platform. Its target, Expedia, is worth around $20 billion.

Uber’s interest in Expedia was first reported by the Financial Times.

Shares of Expedia were up more than 6% Thursday morning.

Expedia users can book flights, lodging, cars and activities through the company’s website, and it owns additional travel sites like Hotels.com, Vrbo and Orbitz. Expedia reported $28.8 billion total gross bookings in its second-quarter results in August.

An acquisition of Expedia would be a ”’major strategic home run” for Uber, Dan Ives, Wedbush Securities managing partner, told CNBC’s “Squawk Box” on Thursday. He said this suggests Uber is going on offense and looking for new monitization opportunities, and it could be a step toward a “super app.”

“They have a massive mojo, and they’re just gaining more and more share,” Ives said. “I think they’re going to be on the hunt for M&amp;A.”

Do any of you guys have European stocks as a significant part of your portfolio? I am worried that mainly owning American stocks and ETFs puts me at a massive risk in case of a downturn. Especially considering the P/E ratios of American stocks are much higher than those of their European counterparts at the moment.

Would you consider buying some European (mainly Dutch, Danish and so) stocks in order to reduce your exposure to a potential heavy drop in American stocks? Or do you think in such scenario European stocks would drop just as much? In that case, the (expected) lower gains of European markets up to that point would mean owning them was not worth it.

Thank you very much in advance!

Title: ELI5: UAL stock buyback edition
Text
 First off, congrats to anyone else who bought UAL during the pandemic.

Ever since their announcement a few days ago, I've been hearing a lot of talk about their stock buyback. Some good, some bad.

I have a very basic understanding of stock buybacks (as in I watched 2 YouTube videos on it this morning), so I don't quite understand what this means for UAL. Can someone explain?

Bonus question: How should this affect when I sell UAL?

Title: What are your thoughts on Tesla's upcoming earnings? 
Text
 Some of the news I've seen so far has been negative: the company missing production target, horrors of cybertruck, increasing competition outside states due to cheaper Chinese cars, the recent disappointing cybercab event, and now FSD being investigated for killing pedestrians. The only bullish thing I saw were the increasing sales in China. What are your thoughts for the upcoming earnings and why?

Title: ASML’s issues should have been a positive for TSMC and Intel
Text
 If the China export restrictions are the primary cause for ASML’s weakness, then that must mean that TSMC and Intel will have an easier time acquiring ASML machines. 

One of the biggest costs for chip fabs is the machines. It’s the reason TSMC has not invested heavily into high NA EUV machines because they are simply too expensive to make sense economically right now. 

With nearly half of ASML’s market wiped out over night, TSMC and Intel should have a much easier time securing these machines faster and at a lower price due to less competition. 

Therefore, the analysts were wrong. They should have saw this and bought up TSMC and Intel instead of selling all semiconductor stocks after ASML’s report.

Title: I Flipped My Entire Portfolio of ETFs for AI Stocks
Text
 Yesterday, I made a major shift in my stock portfolio. I used to rely on ETFs like SPY, QQQ, and SCHD, but now I’ve sold most of them and focused on NVDA, MSFT, GOOGL, ISRG, AAPL, SCHG, and a bit of SOXX.

 - NVDA $237K

 - SCHG $121K

 - MSFT $105K

 - GOOGL $78K

 - AAPL $74K

 - ISRG $64K

 - SOXX $61K

 - BRK-B $47K

Here’s why: Right now, AI might feel limited to things like ChatGPT, but its potential goes far beyond that. Over the next 3, 5, or 10 years, AI is going to transform industries in ways we can’t fully imagine yet. We’re talking about healthcare revolutionizing how we diagnose and treat patients, transportation with autonomous vehicles and drones making logistics smarter and more efficient, and manufacturing, where AI will optimize production processes and supply chains.

Now, I know what you're thinking: 'What, you think the world is full of cave dwellers? Who doesn't know that?' and you're right. Everyone knows AI techonology will be advanced and utilized in so many ways in the near future.

But look, you can think of it like real estate. Sure, property values rise while new highways or shopping centers are being built, but the real surge in value happens once people start using them and see the full benefits. Right now, AI is still in its “under construction” phase—people can imagine the future potential, but the true value hasn’t been fully realized yet. The market has priced in expectations, sure, but once AI is fully integrated across industries and we start seeing its widespread, real-world impact, I believe we’ll see another major surge in stock prices. What’s priced in now is just the beginning—the real growth will come as AI starts transforming daily life and business on a much larger scale.

Before ChatGPT went mainstream, people assumed ‘just’ that level of AI technology would arrive soon enough, but they didn’t think it would have this much of an impact on stock prices once it came to life for the public. Everyone knew advanced AI was on the horizon, but the market didn’t price it like they do now. This shows just how much underestimation happens until we truly start experiencing the technology firsthand. And that’s why, despite what’s already been priced in, I think AI stocks are still undervalued given the game-changing growth ahead. Anyone else rethinking their portfolio with AI at the center?

Title: Amazon goes nuclear, to invest more than $500 million to develop small modular reactors
Text
 https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2024/10/16/amazon-goes-nuclear-investing-more-than-500-million-to-develop-small-module-reactors.html

Amazon Web Services is investing over $500 million in nuclear power, announcing three projects from Virginia to Washington State. AWS, Amazon's subsidiary in cloud computing, has a massive and increasing need for clean energy as it expands its services into generative AI. It's also a part of Amazon's path to net-zero carbon emissions.

AWS announced it has signed an agreement with Dominion Energy, Virginia's utility company, to explore the development of a small modular nuclear reactor, or SMR, near Dominion's existing North Anna nuclear power station. Nuclear reactors produce no carbon emissions.

An SMR is an advanced type of nuclear reactor with a smaller footprint that allows it to be built closer to the grid. They also have faster build times than traditional reactors, allowing them to come online sooner.

Amazon is the latest large tech company to buy into nuclear power to fuel the growing demands from data centers. Earlier this week, Google announced it will purchase power from SMR developer Kairos Power. Constellation Energy is restarting Three Mile Island to power Microsoft data centers.

"We see the need for gigawatts of power in the coming years, and there's not going to be enough wind and solar projects to be able to meet the needs, and so nuclear is a great opportunity," said Matthew Garman, CEO of AWS. "Also, the technology is really advancing to a place with SMRs where there's going to be a new technology that's going to be safe and that's going to be easy to manufacture in a much smaller form."

Virginia is home to nearly half of all the data centers in the U.S., with one area in Northern Virginia dubbed Data Center Alley, the bulk of which is in Loudon County. An estimated 70% of the world's internet traffic travels through Data Center Alley each day.

Dominion serves roughly 3,500 megawatts from 452 data centers across its service territory in Virginia. About 70% is in Data Center Alley. A single data center typically demands about 30 megawatts or greater, according to Dominion Energy. Bob Blue, its president and CEO, said in a recent quarterly earnings call that the utility now receives individual requests for 60 megawatts to 90 megawatts or greater. Dominion projects that power demand will increase by 85% over the next 15 years. AWS expects the new SMRs to bring at least 300 megawatts of power to the Virginia region.

"Small modular nuclear reactors will play a critical role in positioning Virginia as a leading nuclear innovation hub," said Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin in a release. "Amazon Web Services' commitment to this technology and their partnership with Dominion is a significant step forward to meet the future power needs of a growing Virginia."

AWS plans to invest $35 billion by 2040 to establish multiple data center campuses across Virginia, according to an announcement from Youngkin last year.

"These SMRs will be powering directly into the grid, so they'll go to power everything, part of that is the data centers, but everything that is plugged into the grid will benefit," Garman added.

Amazon also announced a new agreement with utility company Energy Northwest, a consortium of state public utilities, to fund the development, licensing and construction of four SMRs in Washington State. The reactors will be built, owned and operated by Energy Northwest but will provide energy directly to the grid, which will also help power Amazon operations.

Under the agreement, Amazon will have the right to purchase electricity from the first four modules. Energy Northwest has the option to build up to eight additional modules. That power would also be available to Amazon and Northwest utilities to power homes and businesses.

The SMRs will be developed with technology from Maryland-based X-energy, a developer of SMRs and fuel. Along with Amazon's other announcements, Amazon's Climate Pledge Fund disclosed it is the lead anchor in a $500 million financing round for X-Energy. The Climate Pledge Fund is its corporate venture capital fund that invests in early-stage sustainability companies. Other investors include Citadel Founder and CEO Ken Griffin, affiliates of Ares Management Corporation, NGP and the University of Michigan.

"Amazon and X-energy are poised to define the future of advanced nuclear energy in the commercial marketplace," said X-energy CEO J. Clay Sell. "To fully realize the opportunities available through artificial intelligence, we must bring clean, safe, and reliable electrons onto the grid with proven technologies that can scale and grow with demand."

Last spring, AWS invested in a nuclear energy project with Talen Energy, signing an agreement to purchase nuclear power from the company's existing Susquehanna Steam Electric Station, a nuclear power station in Salem Township, Pennsylvania. AWS also purchased the adjacent, nuclear-powered data center campus from Talen for $650 million.

Title: Robinhood Launching a Trading Platform to compete with IBKR etc

 What are your thoughts on Robinhood Legend? I think the move upmarket is the right direction. Advanced trading features, index options etc for the browser is a very different user experience from the app.

I'm only familiar with Interactive Brokers Trader Workstation/Desktop at an enterprise level. But there are a dozen competitors here (TradingView etc). The multi-screen, dynamic linking features look good.

Combined with crypto, the Gold Card etc, Robinhood has definitely diversified its customer + product base. Very impressive and now it has room to go beyond its $25b market cap.

Title: Cloud software or Nuclear power. Which sector most benefit from massive data center infrastructure ?
Text
 Already heavily in semi-industry, so some diversification but stay close to tech industry (focus in smaller-cap high growth).

So far, I can only think of

data/cloud-related software Pro: fast-scale up, high gross margin. Cons: saas are growing slower and AI-capex return are worrying investors. Examples: servicenow, datadog etc. I also think about cloud cybersecurity stock like cloudflare (might benefit from more datacenter usages) but cybersecurity stock underperforms relative to others.

Nuclear power stocks, pro: real demand from data center (unlike cloud-software, capex surely pays off). cons: slow-scale up,  and regulation; Small modular reactors is easier comparing to traditional ones, but such manufacturing is U.S. weakness and could be potentially overwhelmed by China supply chain.

the recent hyped going much earlier than any of these reactors been built or put into use. Sounds like already miss out.  Not so sure about the moat and gross margin ?

which one is better to go?

Title: Sanofi: Influenza and Covid-19 vaccine strategy at risk?
Text
 Sanofi licensed the Matrix-M adjuvant from Novavax after Sanofis mRNA influenza vaccine development failed while Moderna succeded. Now Novavax is in trouble because of nerve damage that was potentially(!) caused by a traditional vaccine containing the Matrix-M adjuvant.

The results so far? Novavax stock price has declined more than 20%, Moderna stock price is down 2.5% and the Sanofi stock price is up a bit...

There are negative things to say about Novavax, but the Matrix-M adjuvant is really good and was the strategy for future Sanofi vaccines in the absence of mRNA vaccines. Now this adjuvant has potentially caused nerve damage. I don't think it's likely that the nerve damage is related to the Matrix-M adjuvant. But it could be. And I don't understand why that doesn't seem to concern anyone.

"**All three vaccine candidates contained Novavax's patented Matrix-M adjuvant** and showed reassuring preliminary safety profiles and reactogenicity that was comparable to Fluad and Fluzone HD."

Title: United Airlines plans $1.5 billion share buyback, beats estimates for Q3
Text
 United Airlines said Tuesday that it is starting a $1.5 billion share buyback as the carrier reported higher-than-expected earnings for the busy summer travel season and forecast strong results for the last three months of the year.

Shares of the airline were up roughly 9% in morning trading Wednesday, heading for their highest close since February 2020, before Covid-19 was declared a pandemic.

United expects to earn an adjusted $2.50 to $3.00 a share in the fourth quarter, compared to $2.00 a share a year earlier and the $2.68 analysts polled by LSEG estimated.

Here is what United reported for the third quarter compared with what Wall Street expected, based on average estimates compiled by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $3.33 adjusted vs. $3.17 expected

Revenue: $14.84 billion vs. $14.78 billion expected

The share buyback would be United’s first since before the Covid-19 pandemic. U.S. airlines received more than $50 billion in government aid during the pandemic travel slump that prohibited share repurchases and dividends, though airlines were still fighting for financial stability.

Southwest Airlines announced a $2.5 billion share repurchase program last month.

“Like other leading airlines and companies, we are initiating a measured, strategic share repurchase program,” United CEO Scott Kirby said in a note to staff on Tuesday. “Importantly, my commitment to you is that investing in our people and our business will always be my top priority even while we institute this share repurchase program.”

For the third quarter, United posted revenue of $14.84 billion, up 2.5% from a year earlier and above analysts’ estimates. It reported net income of $965 million, down 15% from a year ago.

United said domestic unit revenue was positive in August and September compared to last year as airlines trimmed a glut of flights that were pushing down fares. United expanded capacity by 4.1% in the third quarter. The carrier said corporate revenue rose 13% in the quarter; premium revenue, including business class tickets, rose 5%; and sales from its no-frills basic economy tickets were up 20%.

The airline last week unveiled a far-flung expansion for next year that included new flights to Mongolia, Senegal, Spain and Greenland in a chase for international travel demand.

Adjusting for one-time items, United reported earnings per share of $3.33, topping Wall Street forecasts and United’s estimate in July of $2.75 to $3.25 a share.

Airline executives will hold a call with analysts at 10:30 a.m. ET on Wednesday and will likely face questions about demand for the end of the year and into 2025, as well as production problems at Boeing, where most factories have been idled during a more than monthlong machinist strike.

United’s flight attendants’ union, which hasn’t yet reached a new labor agreement with the company slammed the airline’s decision to resume buybacks.

In a statement, Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, which represents crews at United, Spirit, Alaska and other carriers, said: “That money United just promised Wall Street belongs to Flight Attendants who worked throughout the pandemic and during this taxing recovery for all of us on the frontlines.”

Title: Large cap tech, Nvidia, and by extension US index funds are likely to crash, small cap value/international to outperform. Here's why
Text
 If you look at the story of how the S&amp;P500 has performed so well over the past decade, the answer is high return on invested capital from tech companies. By hiring top engineers to build innovative products, and scaling the product globally, these companies to achieved rapid growth at little cost, resulting in impressive returns to shareholders. Historically, hardware costs were very cheap to scale compared to the revenue it brings in. You could spend a few thousand per month in hosting costs, and bring in millions in profits.

However, this is changing. 7 out of 10 of the top holdings in the S&amp;P500 are gambling huge on AI- they have laid off tens of thousands of the talented engineers that drove their earnings growth, in order to fund expensive acquisitions of AI hardware(Not counting Nvidia because they are the ones profiting from it).

Tech can no longer be seen as an industry with low capital costs, because AI is tremendously expensive to deploy and maintain. For example, Microsoft expects to spend $100 Billion on AI datacenters through Fiscal 2027. That's 40% more than their entire profit in 2023. Because AI hardware is so expensive, and the electricity usage is so tremendous, these future applications are no longer cheap to deploy and maintain.

ChatGPT is perhaps the best example of this. Despite being tremendously successful from a growth perspective, it has been tremendously unprofitable from an operating standpoint, and relies on continued bailouts from large companies like Microsoft, Nvidia, and Softbank to stay afloat. 

The economics of tech companies is quickly changing; with companies in an arms race to acquire as many Nvidia chips as possible to build the best GenAI applications, they are hurting their margins and operating profitability.

The impact of these investments has been quite lousy so far; other than some round tripping transactions to create fake revenue and balance sheet growth, these ai investments, while tremendously expensive, have not paid off:

- Microsoft's CoPilot has been a complete failure, consumers are not buying CoPilot pcs, and the CoPilot app has a 2.3 star rating on the Windows store. They are also facing regulatory pressure in Europe over Recall.

- Google's AI is providing dangerous and potentially deadly misinformation to users of its search engine, such as incorrect advice about prescriptions.

- Amazon's "Go" stores were supposed to use ML/AI to handle checkouts, when in reality, the AI failed to handle most of the work, and the remainder was just outsourced to human operators in India which struggled to keep up with the workload.

- Tesla has still failed to implement full self driving, and during its robotaxi event, had human actors control the robots to fake them being AI controlled.

- Google's Waymo is very impressive from a technology standpoint, but its hardware costs and regulatory barriers make it unlikely to achieve profitability, even as it expands.

Despite the poor results of AI investments so far, all of the top 10 holdings in the S&amp;P500 other than Berkshire Hathaway trade at very high P/E Ratio, suggesting that very high earnings growth is priced in.

Even if AI will have a significant impact on the economy and society, the economics of it are not favorable to investors due to the high capex costs involved. Tech is no longer an industry where a team of 10-20 engineers can build a product that brings in Billions in revenue, with minimal hosting costs. It is now an industry where Billions of capital expenditures are needed just to build a model, and margins on the finished product are very poor.

Of course, tech CEOs realize this; which is why Microsoft, OpenAI, and Google are all working to replace Nvidia hardware, which sells at a huge markup, with their own in house chips. This is a tremendous threat to Nvidia's long term prospects.

Given the high expectations implied by elevated price to earnings ratios, and the poor financial performance of AI applications, it does seem quite unlikely that large caps will continue to outperform.

Small cap value and international stocks are almost certainly a better investment; if AI does drive significant productivity improvements, then labor heavy businesses will benefit from improved margins from using these products that large tech companies are offering.

Looking at small cap value funds like AVUV, and international stock indexes, there are a tremendous amount of labor intensive businesses with low margins in these funds that would benefit from AI/ML. Net margins going from 3% to 10% due to improved productivity would mean earnings more than tripling.

This has historically been the case with technical revolutions. For example, railroads revolutionized our economy and drove tremendous economic growth, but they provided terrible returns to shareholders.

Title: Qualcomm Said to Wait for US Election to Decide Intel Move
Text
 Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM) is likely to wait until after the US presidential election in November before deciding whether to pursue an offer to buy Intel Corp. (INTC), people familiar with the matter said.

San Diego-based Qualcomm wants greater clarity on the new occupant of the White House before deciding its next move because of the impact any future administration would have on the antitrust landscape and America’s relationship with China, according to the people, who asked not to be identified discussing confidential information.

Qualcomm could opt to wait until after the inauguration of the new US president in January before deciding how to proceed, given the many complexities of a potential transaction involving Intel, some of the people said.

A combination of Qualcomm and Intel, whose products are key to the digital framework supporting everyday life — from smartphones to electric vehicles — would almost certainly draw intense scrutiny from antitrust regulators in the US and around the world. That includes China, a key market for both Qualcomm and Intel.

Qualcomm made a preliminary approach to Intel on a possible takeover of its struggling rival in September. In the same month, the company made informal inquiries with antitrust regulators in China to gauge their stance on any potential deal, some of the people said. Qualcomm hasn’t received any feedback from Chinese authorities, which are waiting to see if the company actually makes a formal bid, they said.

Intel is at the heart of the US government’s plan for a homegrown chipmaking renaissance, making the political backing for any deal crucial. The Biden administration has consistently framed the importance of its chipmaking policy in national security terms. Intel is in line to get the biggest allocation of funding under the 2022 Chips and Science Act, if it goes ahead with all of its factory building plans. Qualcomm has been speaking with US regulators and believes an all-American combination could allay any concerns, people familiar with the matter have previously said.

Making a bid after the election may bring other advantages for Qualcomm. Intel will report third-quarter earnings later this month. If that follows the pattern of the disappointing announcement of three months ago and the impact it had on the potential target’s stock price, it could make a deal considerably less expensive for Qualcomm. This time around, analysts are predicting another net loss in excess of $1 billion for Intel.

Qualcomm’s deliberations are ongoing and there’s no certainty that the company will decide to pursue an offer for Intel and the timing could change, the people said. Representatives for Qualcomm and Intel declined to comment, while the State Administration for Market Regulation in China didn’t respond to requests for comment.

Under Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger, Intel has been working on an expensive plan to remake itself and bring in new products, technology and outside customers. As part of a recently announced shakeup, Intel intends to turn its programmable chip division into a standalone business and sell shares to the public or seek an investor for it.

Apollo Global Management Inc. has offered to make a multibillion-dollar investment in Intel, Bloomberg News reported last month, providing the chipmaker with a vote of confidence in its turnaround strategy and a possible alternative to any takeover by Qualcomm.

*ASML reports early*

&amp;#x200B;

*In a report on Tuesday, ASML, which is based in Veldhoven, Netherlands, said it expects net sales for 2025 to come in between 30 billion euros and 35 billion euros ($32.7 billion and $38.1 billion), at the lower half of the range it had previously provided.Net bookings for the September quarter were 2.6 billion euros ($2.83 billion), the company said — well below the 5.6 billion euro LSEG consensus estimate. Net sales, however, beat expectations coming in at 7.5 billion euros.The company’s CEO warned of cautiousness among customers and said a “recovery is more gradual than previously expected.”After ASML tanked 16%, other global chipmakers plunged. Nvidia fell 4.7% and AMD lost 5.2%.Also on Tuesday, Bloomberg reported that that Biden administration officials had discussed limiting sales of advanced AI clips from Nvidia to certain countries in the interest of national security, further dampening investor sentiment around the semiconductor sector.ASML has faced a tougher business outlook in China due to U.S. and Dutch export restrictions on its shipments.CFO Roger Dassen said Tuesday that he expects the company’s China business to show a “more normalized percentage in our order book and also in our business.”“So we expect China to come in at around 20% of our total revenue for next year,” he said. In its June-quarter earnings presentation, ASML said that 49% of its sales come from China.ASML’s business in Asia is likely to face continued headwinds, Eugene, Hsiao, head of China equity strategy at Macquarie Capital, said on CNBC’s “Squawk Box Asia” on Wednesday.While “it makes a lot of sense” for ASML to continue working with China from the “economic perspective”, he said, there are “broader issues between governments going into economic problems.”*

Title: Are lithium battery stocks a good buy?
Text
 Lithium batteries are used in the majority of devices we use every day; Laptops, Electric toothbrushes, E bikes, Electric tools, iPhones, vapes etc. they’re even used by manufacturing businesses within their heavy machinery and vehicles - FLASH BATTERY, these batteries are the most popular in Italy specifically and require 0 maintenance while also charging very quick compared to others available.

More importantly, with the ongoing climate crisis, governments of more economically developed countries are pushing their citizens to ‘go green’, promoting electric vehicles, bikes and even solar panels (solar panels can use lithium batteries to store extra energy). 

I am also aware however that sodium ions are a direct substitute to lithium, charging Even quicker and have an even greater life cycle. We seem to just be getting started with sodium ion batteries as the raw material supply chain isn’t very well developed.

What do we think?

Title: Selling covered calls
Text
 Question abt selling covered calls.  I have 100 shares of UAL. I can sell a call at strike price of $23 for $47.  I know the price will be over $23 and it will be executed.  

If it is executed, would I get the $47/share and the current market price of $70?  So $117/share?  Why wouldn’t I do this?

Title: Questions about company received RSUs.
Text
 I am still under educated in the world of stocks and have a few questions. I appreciate any and all help!

1. When selling RSUs I receive through my place of employment, how does the taxation work? Is it a simple capital gains tax on the increase of value since the day it officially vested or from the day I was awarded them and then made to sit through a vesting cycle? For example: I was awarded 55 RSUs in September of 2021 but they didn't vest, and enter my portfolio, until May 2022, Would those gains be from the September 2021 or May 2022?

  
2. If you sell multiple shares of stock and some have been yours for over a year and some not, are long term and short term capital gains taxes figured for each unit sold or is it a package deal? Are you able to choose which ones to sell individually or does it automatically choose FIFO or the opposite?

3. I have an account with Fidelity for my RSUs. Is there a way to see the length of time each RSU has been in my portfolio?

  
Thanks again!

Title: Google to buy nuclear power for AI datacentres in ‘world first’ deal
Text
 https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/oct/15/google-buy-nuclear-power-ai-datacentres-kairos-power

Google has signed a “world first” deal to buy energy from a fleet of mini nuclear reactors to generate the power needed for the rise in use of artificial intelligence.

The US tech corporation has ordered six or seven small nuclear reactors (SMRs) from California’s Kairos Power, with the first due to be completed by 2030 and the remainder by 2035.

Google hopes the deal will provide a low-carbon solution to power datacentres, which require huge volumes of electricity.

The US company, owned by Alphabet, said nuclear provided “a clean, round-the-clock power source that can help us reliably meet electricity demands”.

The explosive growth of generative AI, as well as cloud storage, has increased tech companies’ electricity demands.

Last month, Microsoft struck a deal to take energy from Three Mile Island, activating the plant for the first time in five years. The site, in Pennsylvania, was the location of the most serious nuclear meltdown in US history, in March 1979. Amazon bought a datacentre powered by nuclear energy in March from Talen Energy.

The locations of the new plants and financial details of the agreement were not revealed. Google has agreed to buy a total of 500 megawatts of power from Kairos, which was founded in 2016 and is building a demonstration reactor in Tennessee, due to be completed in 2027.

Michael Terrell, the senior director for energy and climate at Google, said: “The grid needs new electricity sources to support AI technologies that are powering major scientific advances, improving services for businesses and customers, and driving national competitiveness and economic growth.

“This agreement helps accelerate a new technology to meet energy needs cleanly and reliably, and unlock the full potential of AI for everyone.”

Title: Boeing to Sell at Least $10 Billion in Shares to Plug Cash Drain
Text
 *source:* [*https://www.wsj.com/business/boeing-needing-cash-moves-to-sell-new-shares-fce4c116?mod=hp\_lead\_pos1*](https://www.wsj.com/business/boeing-needing-cash-moves-to-sell-new-shares-fce4c116?mod=hp_lead_pos1)

[Boeing](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/BA) [BA -](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/BA) is moving to raise at least $10 billion by selling new shares in a bid to stabilize its increasingly precarious finances.

The jet maker, in a pair of regulatory filings on Tuesday, told investors it could issue up to $25 billion in shares or debt during the next three years while also entering into a new credit agreement with lenders.

Under the shelf registration, Boeing is expected to pursue a stock offering that raises around $10 billion, according to people familiar with the matter.

A [strike by Boeing’s largest union](https://www.wsj.com/business/airlines/boeing-strike-workers-reasons-explained-589c245e?mod=article_inline) is exacerbating financial woes at the jet maker, which last turned a profit in 2018. Its operations had been burning through about $1 billion a month before the strike.

Boeing ended September with $10.3 billion in cash and securities, close to the minimum amount the company has said it needs to operate. 

The new $10 billion credit agreement is in addition to about $10 billion in existing, untapped revolving credit agreements. Boeing has $45 billion in net debt.

“These are two prudent steps to support the company’s access to liquidity,” Boeing said in a statement. Boeing shares, which began the year around $250, were little changed in premarket trading near $150.

Credit-rating firms have warned that the company needed to raise capital and that its debt could be downgraded to junk status.

The company on Friday said it would [cut roughly 17,000 jobs](https://www.wsj.com/business/airlines/boeing-to-cut-10-of-workers-delay-new-plane-394370d5?mod=article_inline) and warned of deeper losses as production of most planes, including its bestselling 737, [is halted](https://www.wsj.com/business/boeing-strike-union-workers-walk-off-af5703df?mod=article_inline) amid a machinists’ strike under way since Sept. 13.

Title: AGBA &amp; Triller Merger Finalized, Now Trading as a Delaware Corporation Under $ILLR 
Text
 Now having \~130 million outstanding shares and opening at $5.60 per share today, this newly combined company is now over $500MM market cap.

[https://www.agba.com/company/newsroom/media-release/agba-completes-merger-with-triller/](https://www.agba.com/company/newsroom/media-release/agba-completes-merger-with-triller/)

&gt;For more information, visit [www.triller.co](http://www.triller.co/).

AGBA was previously trading as a penny stock from Hong Kong, which saw huge gains after the announcement of the merger, reaching at multiple points roughly twice the PPS that it was at before the recent string of good news (the lowest since April still being an order of magnitude above it's PPS prior to the initial announcement). As a Chinese stock, it's value was mainly propped up by the merger. **AGBA is now domesticating and moving it's headquarters to the USA in Delaware, and as a result is no longer a Chinese company.**

Triller was a private American corporation holding assets such as the **Triller app** (very similar concept to TikTok), Triller TV (a streaming service focused mainly on combat sports), and perhaps most valuable right now, is their majority stake in the **American Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship** (**BKFC**). Based in Philadelphia and founded in 2018, BKFC is the first promotion to hold an official state-sanctioned and commissioned bare-knuckle boxing event in the United States since 1889. **Partly owned by** **Conor McGregor** as of April 2024, it's often claimed to be "the fastest-growing combat sport in the world".

Previous AGBA shareholders received a 30% stake in the combined company, while Triller private investors received the other 70%. Importantly, **there is a 165 day lock-up where that 70% of the outstanding shares cannot be traded.** Furthermore, the stated valuation of the combined company according to the merger agreement is **$4 Billion USD (\~$30 per share) - around eight times it's current value if it is to be believed**.

There is a "strategic partnership" between the merged Triller company and Yorkville (YA II PN, LTD), which will come into effect very soon, the terms of which are shown in this 8-K [here](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001769624/000121390024059262/ea0208930-8k_agba.htm). Yorkville has control of a great deal of shares in the form of convertible debt. This will cause dilution, but it is also suspected that they are planning to leverage their power over the stock price to help pump it up significantly in order to get their money's worth and then some. They have not received any shares yet to my understanding, and are likely still holding down the stock's value to get an ideal entry point for at least a few days post-merger. It's not known with certainty, but it's suspected that Yorkville holds a very large short position on this stock, in part to keep the value down for their entry price, but potentially to also manipulate the value upwards after they buy-in by closing those short positions. This would offset the effect of dilution that their sales would have, and if timed right, may even trigger short squeezing and retail FOMO.

There has also been a great deal of hype regarding a **likely TikTok ban** which may come into effect in **mid-January**. The Triller app being a potential alternative to TikTok based in the USA puts it in a good position for massive growth following such a ban, especially if it can be improved using the combined assets of these merged companies. **Barring any delays, this catalyst would take place within the 165 day lock-up window of 70% of this stock's outstanding shares.**

The combination of these factors could spell out a very significant rally for $ILLR in the near future.

I'm currently holding 746 shares at a $4.95 average. My position has been at a 20-30% profit multiple times within the past couple weeks leading to the merger.

Title: Stock recommendation for 7 years - Liquidity of around $110K
Text
 Here is the situation - I bought a house in 2022, with mortgage rate of 2.7% but with 10/1 ARM - so interest rate will change in 2032.    
I never plan to keep the mortgage for 30 years - something about owning money with me does not work - I have another hours bought in 2017 for $330k and paid it off by 2020 - currently converted this to rental and with a market value of roughly around 500K ( thanks covid)   
Coming back to the point, I have been saving money and have roughly around 110K towards paying off the house however I would be stupid if I pay off my mortgage as opposed to just putting it in one of high yield saving account or CD as those are paying more than what I am paying on my mortgage.   
  
I am looking for recommendation of "safe stock" with a vision of 7 years where I can park this money and hopefully dont loose it all. Looking at your advise/suggestions/recommendations for the same.   
  
Thanks.

Title: Found old stock certificate from Paragon Capital Corporation - 1991
Text
 I found this stock certificate in my father's papers - a stock certificate from Paragon Capital Corporation (incorporated in Utah) issued in 1991. A letter from them indicates it's a transfer of his interest in Jay Development Company Paullus A Lease, an Oil and Gas Lease. I'm struggling to find anything useful, even though the certificate has a CUSIP, and I'm Googling like crazy. Info is vague, contradictory, or requires payment, which we don't have. My parents' financial situation is so dire, we can't make their rent this month and they may have to leave their Assisted Living. While I suspect this certificate isn't worth anything, I need to make sure.

Does anyone have any idea about any of this? Any way to look up the CUSIP number that's free? Find out a value on this?

Many thanks.

Title: Nvidia closes at record as AI chipmaker's market cap tops $3.4 trillion
Text
 Nvidia shares closed at a record on Monday as Wall Street gears up for earnings season and updates from all of the chipmaker’s top customers on their planned spending on artificial intelligence infrastructure.

The stock climbed 2.4% to close at $138.07, topping its prior high of $135.58 on June 18. The shares are now up almost 180% for the year and have soared more than nine-fold since the beginning of 2023.

Nvidia, widely viewed as the company selling the picks and shovels for the AI gold rush, has been the biggest beneficiary of the generative AI boom, which started with the public release of OpenAI’s ChatGPT in November 2022. Nvidia’s graphics processing units (GPUs) are used to create and deploy advanced AI models that power ChatGPT and similar applications.

Companies including Microsoft, Meta, Google, and Amazon are purchasing Nvidia GPUs in large quantities to build increasingly large clusters of computers for their advanced AI work. Those companies are all slated to report quarterly results by the end of October.

Of the billions of dollars the top tech companies are spending annually on their AI buildouts, an outsized amount is going to Nvidia, which controls about 95% of the market for AI training and inference chips, according to analysts at Mizuho.

Nvidia’s revenue has more than doubled in each of the past five quarters, and at least tripled in three of those periods. Growth is expected to modestly slow the rest of the year, with analysts projecting expansion of about 82% to $32.9 billion in the quarter ending in October, according to LSEG.

Nvidia recently said that demand for its next-generation AI GPU called Blackwell is “insane” and it expects billions of dollars in revenue from the new product in the fourth quarter.

With a market cap of $3.4 trillion, Nvidia is the second most valuable publicly traded U.S. company, behind Apple at about $3.55 trillion.

Title: SPHD vs SCHD: Which ETF is Better for Dividends and Growth?
Text
 I'm looking to invest in a dividend-focused ETF and have narrowed it down to **SPHD** (Invesco S&amp;P 500 High Dividend Low Volatility ETF) and **SCHD** (Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF). Both seem like solid options, but I'm wondering which one might be better for a long-term investment strategy that balances **dividends** and **growth**. Could i buy both or should i sick to one

From what I can tell:

* **SPHD** focuses on high dividends and low volatility, which sounds great for income stability, but maybe it sacrifices growth?
* **SCHD** seems to focus more on companies with a consistent dividend history, which could lead to better long-term growth.

Title: Talk me out of loading up on $WOLF—2nd edition.
Text
 I’m back. Earlier this year, I made a similar post looking for bear cases on Wolfspeed before ignoring all of them and losing a bunch of money. While I may have been too early in hindsight, the fundamental situation is unchanged.

What has changed is an announcement yesterday that Wolfspeed will be receiving $750MM via the CHIPs act. The best bear case I heard last time was that China would subsidize and subsequently beat the shit out of WOLF. As I speculated, the US has now stepped up to say not so fast. 

A pop is happening now based on the news, but I am more interested in discussing a 2-3 year time horizon and the potential for shares to get into the $150 range.

So bears, where you at? Why can’t this company achieve $3b in annual revenue and profit margins in the mid 20% over the next 2-3 years without overly diluting or succumbing to high debt burden? From my perspective, they have crossed the chasm and done the hardest parts already, but where am I wrong?

 Just couple of days ago I was contemplating between CVS and humana stock and today entire sector went down. UNH stock went back to 2023 Level, only 3% up YTD.

Title: Any company you wanna short? Looking for empty air stocks with 70-100%+ run-ups in 2024
Text
 So obviously like most people, there's my index ETF portfolio. I want to hedge it against the risk of a "doom scenario" which we have been preparing for since 2021.

We all can offer excellent ideas on what companies are great, and which stocks to buy, but I'm looking for easy short ideas, so the inverse function -

* Empty air projections and growth expectations, no moat
* High regulatory risk, e.g. crypto 
* Sky high valuations, abnormal PE, PS ratios 
* Sky high run-up in price, e.g. 70-100% shoot up YTD
* Excessive media attention, which can quickly changes narrative

Couple of ideas that I can think of:

* Tesla (but who knows they might just deliver, finally)
* Walmart (digital is coming, digital is coming since 2010)
* Uber - discretionary spending in recession? Also, it spikes up when Tesla falls, so I don't like the rationale based on other company's failure 
* Vici - casino, hotels, resorts in recession? 
* And, please "murder me" for saying this - NVDA?

Title: Management fees
Text
 Hello folks, 
I was just a little curious how do the fees that are associated with certain funds actually paid.
For example, SCHD which has a fee of 0.6%, how do I as an investor end up paying that fee?

If the fund is 50 USD and rose up to 60 USD, at which point did I pay it and how?
I appreciate the answers in advance!

Title: r/Stocks Daily Discussion &amp; Technicals Tuesday - Oct 15, 2024

 This is the daily discussion, so anything stocks related is fine, but the theme for today is on technical analysis (TA), but if TA is not your thing then just ignore the theme.

Some helpful day to day links, including news:

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help **measure the trajectory of a security.**  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **"priced in"**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

 How do you look/ get info for your stock decisions? 

All full-time and not full-time investors here.

I’ve been investing the last few years (not full time as I have a business) &amp; I’m trying to figure out a good stack/ way to get updated and quality data/information, to make my stock investment decisions. (Buy /hold/sell)…. like for example, institutional and professional traders use a Bloomberg terminal or the Reuters terminal.

There are so many paid unpaid blogs, and people randomly talking about stuff on forums/ Subs. 

Would love to hear how folks are managing this?

Title: How has DJT stock done so well, or held up so well, despite large losses?
Text
 The common explanation is that DJT is a bet on the outcome of the 2024 election, in that it tracks Trump's odds. People are buying DJT as a bet on the success of Trump's campaign.  

I think a second explanation, overlooked, is that the stock market is pricing in the possibility that DJT pivots to a new business, either a new social network or some partnership that is worth billions. DJT gets free advertising from Twitter and media coverage of Trump. So Trump can launch a new product and not have to advertise. Advertising is a huge expense for any business. This is worth something.

Title: The Federal Reserve may have pretty much just hit its 2% inflation target
Text
 In case inflation is no longer an issue, The Fed will deal with its another mandate (i.e. labour market) through cutting interest rates going forward ...

Looks good for the sentiment in the stock market \~

&amp;#x200B;

**The Federal Reserve may have pretty much just hit its 2% inflation target**

[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/11/the-federal-reserve-may-have-pretty-much-just-hit-its-2percent-inflation-target.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/11/the-federal-reserve-may-have-pretty-much-just-hit-its-2percent-inflation-target.html)

*Key Points*

* *This week’s inflation data provided more evidence that the Federal Reserve is nearing its 2% objective, a mark that Goldman Sachs thinks the central bank may have already hit.*
* *From a policy standpoint, lower inflation opens the door for the Fed to keep cutting interest rates.*

&amp;#x200B;

*This week’s inflation data provided more evidence that the Federal Reserve is nearing its objective, fresh on the heels of the central bank’s dramatic interest rate cut just a few weeks ago.*

*Consumer and producer price indexes for September both came in around expectations, showing that inflation is drifting down to the central bank’s 2% target.*

*In fact, economists at Goldman Sachs think the Fed may already be there.*

*The Wall Street investment bank Friday projected that the Commerce Department’s personal consumption expenditures price index for September will show a 12-month inflation rate of 2.04% when it is released later this month.*

*If Goldman is correct, that number would get rounded down to 2% and be right in line with the Fed’s long-held objective, a little over two years after inflation spiked to a 40-year high and unleashed an aggressive round of interest rate hikes. The Fed prefers the PCE as its inflation gauge though it uses a variety of inputs to make decisions.*

*“The overall trend over 12, 18 months is clearly that inflation has come down a lot, and the job market has cooled to a level which is around where we think full employment is,” Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee said in a CNBC interview Thursday after the latest consumer price data was released. “We’d like to get both of them to stay in the space where they are right now.”*

&amp;#x200B;

*Some obstacles ahead*

&amp;#x200B;

*While keeping inflation at bay may not be an easy task, the latest data indicates that though prices are not receding from their troublesome heights of a few years ago, the rate at which they are increasing is pulling back.*

*The 12-month rate for the all-items consumer price index was at 2.4% in September, while the producer price index, a proxy for wholesale inflation and a leading gauge for pipeline pressures, showed an annual rate of 1.8%.*

*Goldman’s projection that the PCE index is heading to 2% is also about in line with tracking from the Cleveland Fed.*

*The central bank district’s “inflation nowcasting” dashboard pegs the 12-month headline PCE rate at 2.06% for September, which would get rounded up to 2.1%. However, on an annualized pace, inflation for the entire third quarter is running at just a 1.4% rate — well below the Fed’s 2% goal.*

*To be sure, there are some caveats to show that policymakers still have some work to do.*

*Core inflation, which excludes food and energy and is a metric that the Fed considers a better measure of longer-term trends, is expected to run at a 2.6% annual rate for the PCE in September, according to Goldman. Using just the consumer price index, core inflation was even worse in September, at 3.3%.*

*Fed officials, though, see the unexpectedly high shelter inflation numbers as a major driver of the core measure, which they figure will ease as a lower trend in rents works its way through the data.*

*Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Sept. 30, addressing the rent situation, said he expects housing inflation to continue to recede while “broader economic conditions also set the table for further disinflation.”*

*From a policy standpoint, lower inflation opens the door for the Fed to keep cutting rates, particularly as it turns its attention to the labor market, though there’s some trepidation about how quickly it should move.*

*September’s half percentage point reduction to a fed funds range of 4.75% to 5% was unprecedented for an economy in expansion, and the Fed at the very least is expected to return to its normal quarter-point pace. Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic even said Thursday he’d be open to skipping a move altogether at the November meeting.*

*“Aggressive easing would risk spiking consumer demand just as it is settling into a sustainable pace,” PNC senior economist Kurt Rankin said in a post-PPI analysis. “This result would in turn put pressure on businesses to meet that demand, re-igniting gains in those businesses’ own costs as they jockey for the necessary resources to do so.”*

*Futures traders are betting on a near certainty that the Fed cuts rates by a quarter point at both the November and December meetings.*

 Curious about what others are thinking in regards of performance 12 months from today. Still learning the ropes so I would love to read your insight and learn from you.

To me, seems that NVDA US is performing great since October of last year, is it going to maintain its overperformance until Oct 2025? Lots of U.S stocks looking promising, redfin looks promising, but again, still learning the ropes haha. 

What process do you follow when researching a company? How do you do it differently than others? Something I'm trying to do is expanding knowledge using OSINT techniques.

Title: Ride-sharing giants Uber, Lyft jump after Tesla’s ‘toothless taxi’ fails to excite investors
Text
 Tesla’s hyped robotaxi unveiling posed a threat to Uber’s ride-sharing aspirations, but it has turned into a boon for the stock instead.

Uber shares had been falling on the initial investor excitement leading up to Thursday’s event — particularly slumping in early August and mid-September — but surged more than 9% on Friday on renewed enthusiasm that the company is well positioned to advance its autonomous vehicle offerings. The move pushed the stock to a 52-week high and it was leading the S&amp;P 500 higher during the session.

That is a massive turnaround for Uber’s stock, which is now up nearly 22% over the past month and about 38% for the year. Lyft, another major player, is also surging about 10% on Friday. By comparison, Tesla’s shares are plunging during Friday’s trading session and are down more than 11% this year, vastly underperforming both the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq, which have each gained around 22% so far this year.

The buzz around Tesla’s highly anticipated cybercab has largely dissipated due to a lack of detail on its latest full self-driving technology advancements and the company’s failure to provide insight on its ride-sharing service strategy or economics, among other expectations investors had.

“TSLA’s toothless taxi is a best-case outcome for UBER,” Jefferies analyst John Colantuoni said in a Friday note, noting that the electric car maker provided ambitious targets but little signs of feasibility.

Title: Question about cost to borrow fee - short selling. 
Text
 Hello everyone,

I’ve heard an opinion that the higher the cost to borrow the stock is, the lower the probability of the short squeeze. 

The explanation was something like that: “the short sellers know what they’re doing, they are not gambling, and if they are willing to pay such a high fee to borrow the stock, they absolutely WILL make sure they get their money back. So, the stock has very low chance of a squeeze”. 

Is it true?

Thanks!

 Why do people push 401ks so much and say that’s a great way to become rich? I understand that if you properly invest in it you will become a millionaire but wouldn’t you only be able to withdraw by 65 or so? I just don’t see why you wouldn’t invest in SPY instead where you could get withdrawal earlier with no penalty. Also 65 is pretty old imo to spend that money. Being rich at 65 doesn’t sound appealing to me. Please lmk if i’m missing something.

Title: Boeing to cut 17,000 jobs as losses deepen during factory strike
Text
 Boeing will cut 10% of its workforce, or about 17,000 people, as the company’s losses mount and a machinist strike that has idled its aircraft factories enters its fifth week.

Boeing expects to report a loss of an $9.97 a share in the third quarter, the company said in a surprise release on Friday. It took charges in both its commercial airplane unit and defense business.

The manufacturer also won’t deliver its still-uncertified 777X wide-body plane until 2026, putting it six years behind schedule, and will stop making commercial 767s in 2027, CEO Kelly Ortberg said in a staff memo on Friday afternoon.

“Our business is in a difficult position, and it is hard to overstate the challenges we face together,” Ortberg said. “Beyond navigating our current environment, restoring our company requires tough decisions and we will have to make structural changes to ensure we can stay competitive and deliver for our customers over the long term.”

The job and cost cuts are the most dramatic moves to date from Ortberg, who is just over two months into his tenure in the top job.

He was tasked with restoring Boeing after safety and manufacturing crises, but the labor strike has been the biggest challenge yet for Ortberg. Credit ratings agencies have warned the company is at risk of losing its investment-grade rating, and Boeing has been burning through cash in what company leaders hoped would be a turnaround year.

S&amp;P Global Ratings said earlier this week that Boeing is losing more than $1 billion a month from the strike, which began Sept. 13 after machinists overwhelmingly voted down a tentative agreement the company reached with the union. Tensions have been rising between the manufacturer and the union, and Boeing withdrew a contract offer earlier this week.

Title: Tesla is Completely out of Touch with Needs of Taxi Services. 
Text
 Seeing a lot of focus on the Temu Boston Dynamics bot, but not a lot of discussion on the robo taxi. 

How this thing is built tells me how out of touch and unprepared Tesla is to seriously compete in ride servicing. 

First off this thing has two seats, that alone is such a dumb design decision. It had to be Elon that said to keep it as two seats so it looks futuristic and aesthetic. What if I want to travel with a small group of people? I’m not using the LAX shuttle van at that point, I’m immediately turning to a competitor. Haven’t really seen anyone comment on how out of touch and unnecessary that was. 

One other concern I have is how Tesla primarily uses cameras. What if there are sirens and a fire truck, ambulance, or police car is blowing through an intersection. Other autonomous vehicles incorporate sound, I’m not too sure Tesla does. If not it sounds like a lawsuit waiting to happen. 

Beyond this there’s the ridiculous price tag he put on it which it’ll probably be nowhere close to. 

What are other people’s thoughts on this, did anything with this Robotaxi actually look like a feasible product to you? It looks like an aesthetic toy, but not an actual product that can compete in the space. Based on my understanding of a typical car design cycle, redesigning this to add four instead of just 2 seats would take probably another 2-4 years at least. To me it seems like they really just showed they lost on their biggest bet in the near future. 


Edit: Alright read through the comments, and still think the 2 seat no steering wheel design is stupid. People are saying this is meant to also be a personal commuter car. So my choices are to buy a 30K Robotaxi (knowing Tesla’s history this WILL be priced higher) and then ALSO get a model 3 or model Y to drive around my family for ANOTHER 40K when I can just get ONE model 3 or any other self driving car, no Robotaxi and do everything I need? How is that budget friendly at all, and if there’s a nicer car with a steering wheel that self drives why would I buy something without the option of a steering wheel? 
Still a toy.
 
Also, if it’s for personal use, how does this know where to park at my office or how to get past a security gate to private property? If I live in a condo building with a garage how does it know how to get out of the parking garage and where my parking space is? It makes no sense as a personal car for a LOT of people.

And even if the majority of taxi rides are 1-2 people, why not just use a model 3 that’s 10K more, already exists, and can service that additional 15-20% of your taxi market (given the Robotaxi is definitely not gonna cost 30K and over the life of the car the extra seats pay for themselves). You also save on all the costs that it took to make a stupid 2 seater when it came to expanding production lines/capacity, testing, and designing the pointless thing. 

My opinion doesn’t change this thing shouldn’t exist, and it’s out of touch with what most people need. Total waste of time when they could’ve focused on actually competing with growing competition in the normal car space where they’re losing their competitive advantage. There’s a reason why Uber and the ex-Waymo CEO were not impressed.

Title: 
Tesla shares drop 6% in premarket after Cybercab robotaxi reveal fails to impress
Text
 Shares of electric vehicle maker Tesla tumbled Friday after the company’s long-awaited robotaxi event — where CEO Elon Musk unveiled the firm’s Cybercab self-driving concept car — failed to impress investors.

Tesla stock was down 5.8% as of 6:33 a.m. ET in premarket trading on Friday.

Musk revealed Tesla’s Cybercab concept vehicle — a low, silver two-seater, has no steering wheels or pedals — on Thursday night. The plan is for the car to be capable of driving itself autonomously when it launches.

The Tesla boss said the company hopes to be producing the Cybercab before 2027, but offered no details on where the cars will be manufactured. He said consumers would be able to buy a Tesla Cybercab for a price tag under $30,000.

He also said he expects Tesla to have “unsupervised FSD” up and running in Texas and California next year in the company’s Model 3 and Model Y electric vehicles. FSD, which stands for Full Self-Driving, is Tesla’s premium driver assistance system, available today in a “supervised” version for Tesla electric vehicles.

The technology still requires a human driver at the wheel, ready to steer or brake at any time.

In reaction to the Thursday event, analysts at Barclays said that the revelations had failed to highlight any near-term opportunities for Tesla, instead prioritizing Musk’s vision for a fully autonomous driving future.

“As expected, like prior Tesla product unveils, the event was light on the details, and instead emphasized the vision underpinning Tesla’s growth endeavors in AI/AV \[autonomous vehicles\],” Barclays’ U.S. autos &amp; mobility team wrote in the note early on Friday.

“Yet there were no updates indicating near-term opportunities. Tesla didn’t show its low-cost model planned for 1H′25 production,” they added. “We also didn’t get any near-term updates on FSD progress, or data reflecting improvement in the system.”

Piper Sandler analysts said in a separate Friday note that “most trading-oriented firms will be underwhelmed by the robo-taxi unveiling.”

“We wouldn’t be surprised if the stock sells off in the coming weeks, as pre-event momentum fizzles,” the investment bank’s analysts said in the note.

Morgan Stanley, meanwhile, suggested that Musk failed to make the case that Tesla is an AI company during the event. The bank’s analysts noted that Musk didn’t mention any details on improvements to Tesla’s FSD system, nor did the billionaire go into detail regarding rumored plans of a tie-up between Tesla and xAI, Musk’s AI company. Musk has previously denied such reports.

The event “overall disappointed expectations on a number of areas: a lack of data regarding rate-of-change on FSD/tech, ride-share economics and go-to-market strategy,” Morgan Stanley’s analysts wrote in a note Friday.

“We were overall disappointed with the substance and detail of the presentation. As such, we anticipate TSLA to be under pressure following the event,” they added.

It is expected to take some years still before self-driving cars become a mainstream reality on public roads, with regulators concerned over the safety features embedded into such vehicles.

Among the few companies that have successfully launched self-driving cars on public roads is Google’s Waymo, which has offered its robotaxi service to the general public since June.

Title: RDDT is going to crush its next 2 earnings and you are overlooking it
Text
 **"B-but reddit sucks and fuck spez... amirite?"** Yeah yeah yeah, it's super cool to hate on Reddit as a Redditor.

That doesn't change the fact that you are using the platform right now, and YoY daily active users increased by 37% as of the first RDDT earnings call.

**"But Reddit has never made a profit"** - Yes, low expectations are why this is an opportunity. As dumb as it sounds, Reddit has never *tried* to be profitable. This is changing as they are now a public company with fiduciary responsibility.

1. **Advertising -** RDDT's huge investment in improving their advertising technology for advertising customers is beginning to manifest. They are beginning to **finally** enable effective target marketing based on user interests, demographics, etc. **Remember, Reddit user interests and hobbies are neatly sorted into what subreddits they are subscribed to, visit, and their comment history.** I can feed an AI a Reddit user's comment history and it will create a pretty accurate profile of their interests, hobbies, age, location, and problems. **This is a medium absolutely RIPE for advertising, and Reddit's recent partnership with OpenAI WILL be leveraged for both target marketing and advertisement creation.**
2. **Reddit marketing campaign -** Reddit's marketing campaign to get companies advertising on Reddit is in full force. Ads are beginning to swarm Facebook and Instagram. I believe that based on the companies I've seen advertising on Reddit recently (Apple, Samsung, HIMS, small businesses, and much more) that it has been effective at gaining customers. 
3. **Reddit user growth 37% YoY -** Reddit's partnership with Google is serving up Reddit to normies in swathes. People who might not have been aware of it have been using it for research, opinions, hobbies, etc. Many of these people will, and are, being pulled in as full reddit users. **I caught my normie wife using reddit for her crafting hobbies and pregnancy products research. People are appending "reddit" to their Google searches because they crave authentic human discussion**. This is not even mentioning short term catalysts for people visiting reddit for human discussion: *2024 US presidential election and associated turmoil*
4. **Reddit user demographics -** Reddit is inherently commercial. People discuss purchases, hobbies, and interests constantly. Its users are also largely high income individuals in 1st world countries between the ages of 18 to 40. This is the most valuable demographic for advertisers, as these people actually have discretionary spending ability.
5. **Reddit's moat and competitive advantage** - Reddit's collection of communities and cultures spanning almost every interest has kept it growing steadily for over a decade. No other single platform beats it for ANY individual to find several communities that meet their interests in one place, share news, participate in authentic human discussion, and access a treasure trove of questions asked by users over the past decade. Reddit doesn't always have the best answers to questions, but its discussions are largely real people sharing honest opinions, and that has a lot of value.

-----------Long term bull cases----------

**6. AI Data Deals** - AI is getting more advanced and will rapidly continue to do so for the next decade. Reddit contains 15 years of human discussion on every topic imaginable, and it is constantly building its data for every fresh topic. This is a valuable data source for LLM training, and there could be growth in this sector. **"B-But pizza glue" -** We are still in the early stages, and the pros will outweigh the cons long term.

**7. Reddit Marketplace** - It's only a matter of time before reddit facilitates C2B and C2C transactions for its many hobbies and interests. There is money to be made there.

8. **Meme stock potential -** Reddit has made the news countless times. For the past few years, it has become a meme stock generator attracting the attention of institutions and retail investors alike. If it starts to spike, which it will, I can see the potential for a "meme buy-in" of a stock like RDDT.

9. **Acquisition** - If big tech decides to acquire reddit for any number of good reasons, you win as a shareholder as they will pay a premium.

10. **International expansion and AI translation -** Reddit is investing heavily in using AI to translate all content as human readable across all languages, with the goal of connecting people internationally and expanding its audience internationally. There is a shit ton of money to be made internationally and it is only a matter of time before this occurs.

**"When is the next earnings call?"** - August 6th. I think this has the potential to crush, and the following one in early November will have even more potential.

**Similar company valuation comparison:** I believe the following valuations are FAIR for how much revenue has been reported recently, but I believe it does not account for what will be a big surge in RDDT revenue. Reddit will easily meet the valuation of Pinterest, making it 3x. Longer term, I see 8x-10x.

**RDDT - 10.6bil**

**PINTEREST - 28bil**

**SNAP - 24bil**

**"Okay what's your position then?"**

Title: Reddit shares soar 16% on earnings beat and better-than-expected forecast
Text
 Reddit shares jumped 16% in extended trading on Tuesday after the social media company reported third-quarter results that topped analyst estimates and issued an optimistic forecast for the current period.

Here’s how the company did compared to LSEG estimates:

* **Earnings per share:** 16 cents vs. a loss of 7 cents
* **Revenue:** $348.4 million vs. $312.8 million expected

Reddit said fourth-quarter revenue will be between $385 million to $400 million, beating the average analyst estimate of $357.9 million. Adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter will be in the range of $110 million to $125 million, higher than the $85.2 million average estimate.

Revenue in the third quarter jumped 68% from a year earlier, and the company turned profitable, reporting net income of $29.9 million, compared to a net loss of $7.4 million during the same quarter a year ago.

The company said that its daily active users grew 47% year-over-year in the third quarter to 97.2 million, better than analyst estimates of 96.5 million.

Average revenue per user was $3.58 for the third quarter, which beat analyst estimates of $3.24.

“It was another strong quarter for Reddit and our communities as we achieved important milestones, including new levels of user traffic, revenue growth, and profitability,” Reddit CEO Steve Huffman said in a statement. “Reddit continues to be one of the most visited and trusted sites in the world with opportunities available to us that aren’t available to most companies.”

This is Reddit’s third earnings report since going public in March. The stock has more than doubled in value since its IPO, closing on Tuesday at $81.74, giving the company a market cap of $13.6 billion.

Since last year, Reddit has benefited from Google search updates that helped push its content higher in results, bringing in a flood of new users to the 19-year-old social media service. However, the newer users, which Reddit refers to as logged-out users, generate less online advertising revenue for the company than logged-in users, who typically spend more time on the platform, Reddit has detailed in financial filings.

The company said that global logged-out users grew 70% from a year earlier to 53.1 million, while global logged-in users increased 27% to 44.1 million.

Huffman told CNBC in August that the company has been making it easier for new users to create accounts and is developing more recommendation features to turn newbies into long-term users. He also said that Reddit’s direct traffic is “really resilient” to any Google search changes.

[By Marissa NewmanOctober 29, 2024 at 9:49 AM EDT](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/9984:JP) founder Masayoshi Son said [Nvidia Corp.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/NVDA:US) — the chipmaker that’s seen its market value skyrocket to over $3 trillion amid the artificial intelligence boom — is still undervalued, pushing back against the idea of an AI bubble.

“The future is much bigger,” Son said at the Future Investment Initiative conference in Riyadh on Tuesday. “Nvidia is just one example.”

Son said artificial superintelligence that’s 10,000 times more advanced than human intelligence will be developed by 2035.

Title: Prediction: Apple is grossly priced compared to Microsoft
Text
 Congrats to those that followed my last Costco post. I don’t believe anyone can really predict the ups and downs of the market, and with the current market climbing past ATH’s, the safest bets are going to be balanced long-short positions in specific equities or spread bets. 

**Apple**

* Market cap: 3.6T
* Current P/E: \~36
* Average P/E last 5 years: 28.6
* Historical revenue growth: Flat to single digits
* Earnings growth: Low double digits
* Net Margin: 25%

 **Microsoft**

* Market cap: 3.2T
* Microsoft P/E: \~36
* Average P/E last 5 years: 32.8
* Historical revenue growth: 15%
* Earnings growth: 15-20%
* Net margin: 35%

Last week, Apple had a higher P/E than MSFT, before this narrowed in the last few days Relative to Microsoft. Apple is still at historically high valuations relative to MSFT, despite Microsoft having better margins and growth. And the reasons are silly. Apple is getting a massive boost due to a "potential supercycle" with no proof that it’s actually happening (even the most optimistic projections are just slightly better than last year) and mediocre software releases, while Microsoft took a large hit last quarter because it forecasted larger capex and delays in direct GenAI revenue realization.

In my view, the market is pricing in a divergent and fundamental misunderstanding of GenAI and how it makes money. The Apple bull case hypothesis is correct, it’s just applied to the wrong company. The Microsoft supercycle isn’t going to be from direct GenAI subscriptions like Co-pilot, it’s going to be share shift towards Azure and increased utilization.

To me it is hopium to believe that retail consumers will be rushing aggressively to switch or upgrade their phones over a nascent GenAI capability that is inferior to its peers (other than privacy) and unlocks nominal value, while mid-large corporates won’t be doing the exact same for Microsoft for what is widely considered a top-notch set of capabilities and proven effectiveness in several emerging use cases.

Here’s my prediction – regardless of where the market goes, I believe there is going to be a strong and continued divergence between Microsoft &amp; Apple performance in the next few months, with at least another 5% gap between the winner and loser, with Microsoft’s P/E once against comfortably retaking the lead from Apple. Good luck and we'll see!

Tl;dr: Short Apple / Long Microsoft

P.S. Seeing a lot of people triggered by the tl;dr recommendation not having a basic understanding of what long-short position is. A balanced long-short position doesn't mean I believe Apple will go down on nominal terms, just that it will go down relative to Microsoft. Using options or a long-short position is the way to extract value when you see the spread in two equities increase.

Title: Visa earnings: $9.6B revenue, $5.3 GAAP net income, 13% dividend hike
Text
 Visa (NYSE:V)reported fourth-quarter earnings that surpassed analyst estimates, driven by robust revenue growth across its business segments. The company's shares rose 2% in after-hours trading following the announcement.

The global payments technology company reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $2.71 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, beating the analyst consensus of $2.58. Revenue for the quarter came in at $9.6 billion, exceeding the expected $9.49 billion and representing a 12% increase YoY on both a nominal and constant-dollar basis.

Visa's strong performance was underpinned by stable growth in key metrics. Payments volume for the three months ended September 30, 2024, increased 8% YoY on a constant-dollar basis. Cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe, rose 13% on a constant-dollar basis. Total processed transactions reached 61.5 billion, a 10% increase over the prior year.

Ryan McInerney, Chief Executive Officer of Visa, commented on the results: "Visa had a robust fourth quarter to finish a very strong fiscal year. In the fourth quarter, net revenue and GAAP EPS grew by 12% and 17%, respectively, driven by relatively stable growth in payments volume, cross-border volume and processed transactions plus strong momentum across new flows and value added services."

The company's board of directors approved a 13% increase in Visa's quarterly cash dividend to $0.590 per share, reflecting confidence in the company's financial position and future prospects.

For the full fiscal year 2024, Visa reported net revenue of $35.9 billion, a 10% increase on both a nominal and constant-dollar basis. The company's GAAP net income for the year was $19.7 billion, or $9.73 per share, while non-GAAP net income reached $20.4 billion, or $10.05 per share.

Title: Apple announces new and smaller Mac Mini with first redesign since 2010
Text
 Apple announced on Tuesday new Mac Mini models, featuring the first major redesign since 2010 that makes the desktop computer significantly smaller.

Aside from a redesign that shrunk the case and reduced the computer’s volume in half, the main upgrade on these new computers is that they include Apple’s latest chip, either the M4, or a more powerful version called the M4 Pro.

The Mac Mini is Apple’s least-expensive Mac, starting at $599, and does not include a display, which is sold separately. When the product line was first introduced in 2008, it was marketed as a computer for people switching from Microsoft Windows who could simply plug their existing keyboard, mouse and monitor into their new silver box.

The Mac Mini is not one of Apple’s highest-volume computers in terms of sales, but it is an important slot in Apple’s lineup, especially for people who make apps for iPhones and other Apple platforms. Many iPhone developers like to run a Mac Mini as a personal development server for coordinating uploads and code.

One improvement in the new design is that all of the ports are USB-C ports, the same more modern offering found on Apple’s laptops. There are three USB-C ports on the rear and two on the front, a new addition that will make it easier to plug or unplug accessories while the computer rests on a desk.

Apple said in a press release that the M4 is a significant improvement over the M2 chip in the previous version released in 2022. Graphics and games are more than twice as fast, and the M4 can support up to 14 CPU cores and 20 GPU cores, an increase over the past generation. Apple first introduced the M4 in May in Apple’s iPad Pro.

Apple is framing the new Mac Minis, like all of its new products announced this year, as built for Apple Intelligence, the company’s artificial intelligence system released this week. Apple has said a forthcoming integration of ChatGPT into writing fields inside apps such as Word will allow users to generate and rewrite text and emails using the system.

However, unlike on the iPhone, where only phones released in the past two years will support Apple Intelligence, all of Apple’s computers with the M1 chip and newer since 2020 can run the company’s AI. 

Apple’s Mac family remains a large business segment even though it is less important to the company than the iPhone. In the June quarter, Apple reported $7 billion in Mac sales, up about 2% on an annual basis.

Apple’s chief marketer previously teased a “week of announcements.” The company unveiled new iMac computers on Monday, so it seems plausible more is coming. This week’s new Macs are likely Apple’s last major hardware announcements for the year.

Title: Microsoft's GitHub goes beyond OpenAI, welcomes AI models from Anthropic, Google
Text
 Microsoft has a very expensive and very public relationship with artificial intelligence startup OpenAI. But one of Microsoft’s most successful AI products, GitHub Copilot, is now going beyond OpenAI to give developers more choice in what models they want to use.

GitHub, which Microsoft acquired in 2018, said in a blog post on Tuesday that developers will be able to power the GitHub Copilot Chat feature with Anthropic’s Claude 3.5 Sonnet model or Google’s Gemini 1.5 Pro model, as alternatives to OpenAI’s GPT-4o, if they choose.

“There is no one model to rule every scenario, and developers expect the agency to build with the models that work best for them,” GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke said in the post. “It is clear the next phase of AI code generation will not only be defined by multi-model functionality, but by multi-model choice. Today, we deliver just that.”

Microsoft introduced GitHub Copilot in 2021, offering source code suggestions to software developers. Copilot relies on models from OpenAI, which has received billions of dollars in funding from Microsoft and has exploded in popularity since releasing ChatGPT in late 2022.

OpenAI’s o1-preview and o1-mini, which are meant to reason over difficult problems, will also be available in the Copilot Chat on GitHub’s website and in the open-source Visual Studio Code text editor. They’re currently available in a public preview. Google’s model will be released in public preview in the next few weeks, a spokesperson said.

The arrival of the o1 models from OpenAI in September led GitHub to look at adding a dropdown menu for Copilot to provide more options, Dohmke said in an interview with CNBC last week. At that point, it felt like “the right time” to add models from Anthropic and Google, Dohmke said.

Developers will be able to see which model works best for a given programming language or employ the one that adheres to corporate requirements, he added.

Many other Microsoft products, including Teams and Windows, use OpenAI models. And Microsoft continues to provide computing power to OpenAI, which is now valued at $157 billion. But the relationship between the two companies has frayed in the past year, following the sudden ouster and reinstatement of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman in November. The dramatic incident reportedly angered Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella.

In February, Microsoft announced a partnership with early-stage AI model developer Mistral. The following month, Microsoft said it was hiring former DeepMind co-founder Mustafa Suleyman and employees of his startup, Inflection, whose Pi assistant competed with OpenAI’s popular ChatGPT. Over the summer, Microsoft named OpenAI as a competitor in a regulatory filing.

In the past month, GitHub has collaborated with engineering teams from Anthropic and Google on the safety, security and scalability of their models, Dohmke said.

“We are planning on extending that list in the future but have no partnerships to announce at this point,” he said, adding that GitHub wouldn’t want to overwhelm developers with too many choices.

Also on Tuesday, GitHub announced that its Copilot will gain the ability to perform speedy automated reviews of code updates through a public preview.

And GitHub showed a technical preview of a feature named Spark that can compose app prototypes based on text input and refine the designs with a few clicks. Developers will be able to modify the underlying code for the prototypes. Those interested in trying Spark can join a waiting list.

Once they receive access, people using Spark will be able to choose between GPT-4o and Anthropic’s Claude 3.5 Sonnet model, a GitHub spokesperson said.

Title: McDonald's reverses U.S. same-store sales declines in Q3; E. coli fallout looms
Text
 McDonald’s on Tuesday reported quarterly earnings and revenue that beat analysts’ expectations as its U.S. restaurants reversed last quarter’s same-store sales decline.

However, investors are worried about another dent to U.S. sales fueled by a recent E. coli outbreak across 13 states linked to McDonald’s Quarter Pounder burgers. As of Friday, 75 health cases have been tied to the outbreak, including one death of an older adult.

Health authorities have honed in on the burger’s slivered onions as the likely source, and McDonald’s has suspended its relationship with the supplier. Quarter Pounder burgers will return to affected restaurants on a rolling basis this week, sans slivered onions.

“While the situation appears to be contained, and though it didn’t affect Q3 numbers, it’s certainly an important development, which I know is on many of your minds,” CEO Chris Kempczinski told investors on the company’s earnings call, adding that McDonald’s was sorry and is committed to “making this right.”

Shares of the company fell more than 1% in premarket trading.

Here’s what the company reported for the period ended Sept. 30, compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $3.23 adjusted vs. $3.20 expected

Revenue: $6.87 billion vs. $6.82 billion expected

McDonald’s posted third-quarter net income of $2.26 billion, or $3.13 per share, down from $2.32 billion, or $3.17 per share, a year earlier.

Excluding certain items, the fast-food giant earned $3.23 per share.

Net sales rose 3% to $6.87 billion.

The chain’s global same-store sales fell 1.5%, a more drastic decline than the 0.6% that Wall Street was expecting, according to StreetAccount estimates, and was weighed down by the company’s international markets. It’s the second straight quarter that the company’s same-store sales have fallen.

“While we anticipated a challenging environment in 2024, our performance this year has fallen short of our expectations,” Kempczinski said.

U.S. same-store sales rose 0.3%, reversing last quarter’s same-store sales declines but still slightly weaker than the 0.5% increase predicted by StreetAccount estimates. Traffic to its U.S. restaurants was slightly negative, but the company credited its marketing and a $5 value meal launched in late June for the increase in sales.

Diners have pulled back their restaurant spending, leading McDonald’s and its rivals to lean into discounts and other marketing tricks to bring customers back to their restaurants. For example, in August, McDonald’s launched limited-time “Collector’s Edition” cups.

The company’s two international divisions both reported steeper declines in same-store sales compared with the prior quarter. The international operated markets segment, which includes France, Germany and Australia, saw same-store sales shrink 2.1%. The international developmental licensed markets division reported same-store sales declines of 3.5%, driven by weak demand in the Middle East and China.

Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, it’s unclear how the E. coli outbreak might affect U.S. sales, particularly as consumers have grown more picky about how to spend their money and where.

McDonald’s executives have taken steps to reassure customers that the company’s menu items are safe to eat, including pulling Quarter Pounder burgers from menus in the affected areas until its beef patties were cleared as the culprit.

Still, foot traffic to U.S. locations fell roughly 10% in the three days immediately following the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announcement last Tuesday of the E. coli outbreak tied to McDonald’s, according to a research note from Gordon Haskett Research Advisors.

Title: Chipotle misses revenue estimates as same-store sales growth disappoints
Text
 Chipotle Mexican Grill on Tuesday reported mixed quarterly results, despite another quarter of higher traffic to its restaurants. 

Here’s what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: 27 cents adjusted vs. 25 cents expected

Revenue: $2.79 billion vs. $2.82 billion expected

Chipotle reported third-quarter net income of $378.4 million, or 28 cents per share, up from $313.2 million, or 23 cents per share, a year earlier. 

The company’s food and beverage costs increased during the quarter, in part due to Chipotle’s decision to re-emphasize generous portions after social media-fueled backlash over the size of its burrito bowls this summer.

Excluding items, the company earned 27 cents per share.

Net sales climbed 13% to $2.79 billion. 

Same-store sales rose 6%, just shy of StreetAccount estimates of 6.3%. Traffic to restaurants increased 3.3% in the quarter, continuing the chain’s streak of bucking an overall slump in foot traffic across the industry. While many consumers have opted to eat out less, Chipotle has benefitted from having a wealthier customer base that’s willing to pay more for its burritos and bowls. 

During the third quarter, Chipotle brought back its popular smoked brisket for a limited time. It’s currently the most expensive protein, topping even the chain’s steak and beef barbacoa options.

Digital sales accounted for 34% of the chain’s quarterly food and beverage revenue.

The company opened 86 new locations during the quarter, 73 of which included a “Chipotlane” dedicated to online order pickup.

For the full year, Chipotle reiterated its outlook that same-store sales will grow by a mid- to high-single-digit percentage. The company also anticipates that it will open between 285 and 315 new restaurants this year.

Looking to 2025, Chipotle plans to open between 315 and 345 new locations. More than 80% of those restaurants will include a Chipotlane.

The earnings report marks the company’s first since CEO Brian Niccol departed to lead Starbucks’ turnaround. Chipotle’s board has tapped COO Scott Boatwright as the company’s interim chief executive.

Title: Boeing Co. launched a nearly $19 billion share sale, one of the largest ever by a public company to avoid being downgraded
Text
 &gt;Boeing Co. launched a nearly $19 billion share sale, one of the largest ever by a public company, to address the troubled planemaker’s liquidity needs and stave off a potential credit rating downgrade to junk.

&gt;The common-share portion alone would total just under $14 billion, based on Friday’s closing price of $155.01. That would be the largest US share sale since SoftBank Group Corp. sold part of its stake in T-Mobile US Inc. in 2020, data compiled by Bloomberg show.

&gt;The infusion of funds would clear one of new Chief Executive Officer Kelly Ortberg’s most urgent tasks. He is grappling with a balance sheet strained by years of turmoil and the fallout from a strike, now in its seventh week, that is crippling manufacturing of the company’s main cash cow, the 737 Max jetliner. Boeing needs the capital infusion to maintain its investment-grade rating and fund its production ramp-up once the walkout ends.

Title: TVGN seems to be building up potential
Text
 If you followed DRUG’s impressive growth, TVGN might be your next big opportunity. Over the past few months, Tevogen Bio (TVGN) has gained momentum, **surging by over 120%**, driven by a series of strategic advancements. Their recent confirmation of Nasdaq compliance adds financial credibility and shows a commitment to the rigorous standards that appeal to serious investors.

A key catalyst here is Tevogen’s new Letter of Intent with CD8 Technology, focusing on expanding their T-cell therapy capabilities. T-cell therapies are an area of high demand within biotech, appealing to investors due to their potential in treating complex diseases. With this partnership, Tevogen aims to take a leading role in personalized immunotherapies, a sector with substantial growth potential.

Tevogen AI, their dedicated artificial intelligence division, is also advancing drug development, mirroring strategies seen in other successful biotech companies. The AI-driven approach could accelerate drug discovery and deliver highly targeted therapies, positioning TVGN to benefit from trends that have proven profitable in similar cases, like DRUG’s trajectory.

Considering these factors, **many speculate that TVGN could soon reach double figures** as it continues its upward path. Anyone else watching this? Would love to hear thoughts on where you see TVGN going from here!

Title: JPMorgan is suing customers accused of theft in viral 'infinite money glitch'
Text
 JPMorgan Chase has begun suing customers who allegedly stole thousands of dollars from ATMs by taking advantage of a technical glitch that allowed them to withdraw funds before a check bounced.

The bank on Monday filed lawsuits in at least three federal courts, taking aim at some of the people who withdrew the highest amounts in the so-called infinite money glitch that went viral on TikTok and other social media platforms in late August.

A Houston case involves a man who owes JPMorgan $290,939.47 after an unidentified accomplice deposited a counterfeit $335,000 check at an ATM, according to the bank.

“On August 29, 2024, a masked man deposited a check in Defendant’s Chase bank account in the amount of $335,000,” the bank said in the Texas filing. “After the check was deposited, Defendant began withdrawing the vast majority of the ill-gotten funds.”

JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, is investigating thousands of possible cases related to the “infinite money glitch,” though it hasn’t disclosed the scope of associated losses. Despite the waning use of paper checks as digital forms of payment gain popularity, they’re still a major avenue for fraud, resulting in $26.6 billion in losses globally last year, according to Nasdaq’s Global Financial Crime Report.

The infinite money glitch episode highlights the risk that social media can amplify vulnerabilities discovered at a financial institution. Videos began circulating in late August showing people celebrating the withdrawal of wads of cash from Chase ATMs shortly after bad checks were deposited.

Normally, banks only make available a fraction of the value of a check until it clears, which takes several days. JPMorgan says it closed the loophole a few days after it was discovered.

Miami and California

The other lawsuits filed Monday are in courts including Miami and the Central District of California, and involve cases where JPMorgan says customers owe the bank sums ranging from about $80,000 to $141,000.

Most cases being examined by the bank are for far smaller amounts, according to people with knowledge of the situation who declined to be identified speaking about the internal investigation.

In each case, JPMorgan says its security team reached out to the alleged fraudster, but it hasn’t been repaid for the phony checks, in violation of the deposit agreement that customers sign when creating an account with the bank.

JPMorgan is seeking the return of the stolen funds with interest and overdraft fees, as well as lawyers’ fees and, in some cases, punitive damages, according to the complaints.

Criminal cases?

The lawsuits are likely to be just the start of a wave of litigation meant to force customers to repay their debts and signal broadly that the bank won’t tolerate fraud, according to the people familiar. JPMorgan prioritized cases with large dollar amounts and indications of possible ties to organized crime, they said.

The civil cases are separate from potential criminal investigations; JPMorgan says it has also referred cases to law enforcement officials across the country.

“Fraud is a crime that impacts everyone and undermines trust in the banking system,” JPMorgan spokesman Drew Pusateri said in a statement to CNBC. “We’re pursuing these cases and actively cooperating with law enforcement to make sure if someone is committing fraud against Chase and its customers, they’re held accountable.”

I never got paid in stock before, and I have noo idea how to liquidate it when I need actual cash in my bank account. I live in Morocco. The company's abroad.

I have never sold or bought stock so any help is appreciated. Some of my questions are:  
What if need cash on hand? Can I just sell easily ?

What if there's no one to sell to ?

What if the company goes bankrupt ?

Should I contact my bank to convert the stock into money ?

Does it take long to convert ?

Is it as reliable as cash in your bank account ?

Also, any taxes I should worry about ?

EDIT ===========

Thank you all for the helpful comments ! I definitely won't take that job, might try to negotiate actual payment (prolly wont get it, but that's as far as I'll go.)

Title: Snap reports better-than-expected third-quarter results, issues light forecast
Text
 Snap reported better-than-expected third-quarter results on Tuesday, but issued light fourth-quarter guidance. The stock slipped in extended trading.

Here is how the company did:

* **Earnings per share:** 8 cents adjusted vs. 5 cents expected, according to LSEG
* **Revenue:** $1.37 billion vs. $1.36 billion expected, according to LSEG 
* **Global daily active users:** 443 million vs. 441 million expected, according to StreetAccount
* **Global average revenue per user:** $3.10 vs. $3.09 expected, according to StreetAccount

Snap said fourth-quarter sales will be between $1.51 billion and $1.56 billion. The midpoint of its guidance is $1.54 billion, which is below the average analyst estimate of $1.56 billion.

Snap said its adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter will be between $210 million and $260 million. The middle of the range is higher than analysts’ estimates of $230.7 million.

The company’s sales jumped 15% year over year in the third quarter while its net loss narrowed by 58% year over year in the third quarter to $153 million, compared to a net loss of $368 million a year prior.

The number of Snapchat+ paying subscribers is now at 12 million, the company said. That is up from the 11 million it reported in August. The company debuted its subscription service in 2022, pitching it as a way for users to experience exclusive and prerelease features for $3.99 a month.

Snap also announced a $500 million stock repurchase program on Tuesday.

“Our investments in AI and AR are powering new creative experiences for our community and driving innovation across our advertising platform, underpinning our long term growth opportunity,” Snap CEO Evan Spiegel said in a statement.

In September, Snap debuted the fifth generation of its Spectacles augmented reality glasses that people can wear to see digital imagery spliced into the physical world. The new Spectacles are only available to developers who must pay $99 a month for one year if they want to build AR apps for the glasses.

Shortly after Snap announced the new Spectacles, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg revealed the social networking giant’s experimental AR glasses called Orion. Meta’s Orion AR glasses have generated enthusiasm from employees and the company plans to attract developers next year in prelude for an eventual consumer launch.

In a letter to investors, Snap discussed the importance that developers play for the company’s Spectacles and AR initiatives.

“We aspire to be the most developer-friendly platform in the world, and we are excited to offer our new generation of Spectacles to developers as an invitation and inspiration to create new experiences,” Snap said in the letter.

Text
 Volkswagen is considering widespread pay cuts and layoffs as well as the closure or size reduction of its plants in Germany, the company’s works council said Monday.

The Volkswagen management recently presented plans to the council that include a 10% reduction in pay across the board, as well as wage freezes in 2025 and 2026, according to Daniela Cavallo, head of the works council. All factored in, the body estimates workers will suffer pay cuts of around 18% over the period.

Volkswagen also intends to shut three factories and downsize all other plants in Germany, Cavallo said, adding that sweeping job cuts were part of carmaker’s plan.

Title: Ford guides to low end of 2024 earnings forecast as it slightly tops Wall Street's Q3 expectations
Text
 Ford Motor guided to the low end of its previously announced 2024 earnings forecast as it slightly topped Wall Street’s third-quarter expectations.

The Detroit automaker said Monday it now expects adjusted earnings before interest and taxes, or EBIT, of about $10 billion. It had previously guided to between $10 billion and $12 billion. It retained its forecast for adjusted free cash flow of between $7.5 billion and $8.5 billion.

Here’s how the company performed in the third quarter, compared with average estimates compiled by LSEG:

Earnings per share: 49 cents adj. vs. 47 cents adj. expected

Automotive revenue: $43.07 billion vs. $41.88 billion expected

The automaker was under pressure after a disappointing second quarter in which unexpected warranty costs caused the company to miss Wall Street’s earnings expectations.

 I’m new to this strategy. I have a deep itm QQQ 2026. I want to sell to open a call a month out. What if QQQ goes past strike price and I get assigned? I don’t have enough cash to buy and sell. Since it’s IRA account, I can only have limited margin account which doesn’t let me borrow. Also does fidelity automatically exercise for buyer it ITM? Can someone also explain how that makes sense, why would they wanna exercise below breakeven? I’m assuming it’s so it doesn’t expire worthless?

Title: CVS Stock - owned 20 years; hold forever or sell?
Text
 I purchased CVS stock when I was an employee 20 years ago; their ESPP let me set aside part of my pay and buy the stock at a discount. I didn't have many other investments 20 years ago and other than letting the dividend drip over time, i never purchased anymore. My cost basis is around $22 per share.  It currently is 2% of my taxable brokerage account and under 1% of my total networth in CVS stock.  However it has been a dog the last few years and it is getting hammered.  

At such small exposure in my portfolio would you just leave it alone as a "lifetime" stock, or cash out at some point ant move on? It's not enough money to get crazy about and there is some interest in owning it for another 20 years too.

Title: Bloomberg’s estimates on the big four tech giants 
Text
 The big four tech giants are expected to spend a record $56 billion in total capital expenditures in the third quarter, according to the average estimate of analysts aggregated by Bloomberg. Much of that spending will go to NVIDIA and other AI-related device makers, with further increases expected in the coming quarters.
All signs point to continued strong AI-related spending. From chip device maker Asmax (ASML.US) to TSMC (TSM.US), AI has been a big part of this earnings season.
That backdrop has pushed NVIDIA shares higher, while Chief Executive Jen-Hsun Huang has assured that production of its new Blackwell chips is going well and demand is strong. NVIDIA is the biggest beneficiary of the big investment in artificial intelligence computing devices. The stock hit an all-time high last week and now has a market capitalization of about $3.5 trillion, slightly less than Apple (AAPL.US), which is still the world's most valuable company.
To be sure, there are concerns about the big tech companies' spending on artificial intelligence, as investors believe the billions of dollars these companies are investing are generating relatively little revenue. As such, this will be another focus of attention this week when these companies report earnings.
You have to walk the fine line of investing,“ said Paul Marino, chief revenue officer at Themes ETFs, ‘so that investors understand that you're ’not going too far”.
Nvidia's revenue is expected to more than double this year to $125.6 billion, according to the average forecast of analysts compiled by Bloomberg. Next year, the chipmaker's fiscal year 2026, sales are expected to grow 44 percent to $181 billion.
Of course, there are other companies benefiting from high AI spending, including Broadcom, Ultra Micro Computer and Dell Technologies.

I've tried googling the answer and it's hard to find the information. I know it's an ETF, but I want to analyze the S&amp;P500 the same way you would a business. I suspect the earnings growth rate might be too low compared to what the SP500 sells for. It's very hard to find the information for some reason. Might just be me.

Title: Election Play of a Lifetime - Logistics
Text
 10-Year Yields are up as market prices in the possibility of a republican sweep, paving the way for a potentially inflationary environment. 

Trumpy &amp; the good ol' party sweep the election, US throws down its big swinging hammer and tariffs the shit outta everything. 

Chinese get hit with the MAGA tariffs and then think shit, I have all this inventory but I can’t move it. US importers want me to pick up the tab. They think for all of 2 minutes, use that noggin and think “Russia’s sanctioned, but they just sell their energy products to other countries, and then they turn around and sell it to the countries unencumbered by sanctions” 

Meanwhile, markets throw a shit fit and logistics firms go down because those idiots think “oh no, trade war, nobody is going to be trading”. After about 2 days, people’s brains turn back on and think “oh wait, demand is fixed. People still need products like steel. How can they circumnavigate Tariffs quickly before they decide to pull a Toyota and open up satellites in US? Move product to a different country. 

Demand stays fixed. What has changed? Time to ship a product. Who benefits from increased shipping time? Well of course shipping &amp; logistics companies. 

Boom. 

Now I don’t know anything about shipping, but someone smart on here please do some research and tell me what I should look into buying lol. 

Disclaimer: I hate politics and don’t have a dog in this fight. Like most people, I think both candidates are kinda trash. My opinion is based on market sentiment, not what I necessarily think the outcome will be.

Title: Robinhood jumps into election trading
Text
 Upstart broker Robinhood is jumping into the prediction betting game, announcing Monday users can begin trading the 2024 presidential election that is eight days away.

Users can trade a Kamala Harris or Donald Trump contract starting Monday, said the company, as long as they meet certain criteria that include being a U.S. citizen. The trading is being offered through its Robinhood Derivatives unit and ForecastEx, which is operated by Interactive Brokers.

Robinhood jumps into a suddenly crowded politics prediction markets field that grew this month after platform Kalshi won a key ruling against the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which was seeking to stop the election outcome trading. The CFTC is appealing the ruling. Shortly after, Interactive Brokers launched various political contracts, including on the election.

The election markets have generated some controversary this year with some concerned about light volume allowing the markets to be skewed. International platform Polymarket said last week that a single French user was responsible for four accounts spending millions to buy the Trump contract. But Polymarket said an investigation found the trading was not manipulating the market.

“We believe event contracts give people a tool to engage in real-time decision-making, unlocking a new asset class that democratizes access to events as they unfold,” said Robinhood in a statement. For now, only the presidential election contracts will be available to trade on the system.

Odds and gambling platforms do not use methodologies used by traditional political polling, and therefore are not substitutes for political polls.

Title: Selling to rebuy in IRA
Text
 Long story short, I bought a large quantity of shares in a company back in March in my brokerage account that I now believe in on a longer time horizon than I did then.

I am considering selling 20% and buying them back in my Roth with some spare accessible cash I have sitting in there. Problem is, I'm up over 150% on the shares from March, so there will be some tax implications. 

This company does not do dividends now, but they keep dropping hints of them coming in the future. I'd be surprised if they came before 2026-2027, though. Obviously I'd rather them be in my IRA if that is to happen. 

I'm basically wondering if this would be an idiotic move as I am far from a tax expert. I know if i wait til March, it will change the tax status, but I'm expecting a positive move by then off some upcoming headwinds. 

Thank you for any help/advice. I left the ticker out to make it clear this is not a hype post. Have a great day.

Title: Cheaper to buy long call or protective put
Text
 Suppose I like a stock with current price of $100 and I am bullish but nervous and I have 2 options.

1.  But a call with 1 year expiring with strike 100

2. Or buy stock with cash. And a put with strike 100.

Both options are for 1 year and I intend to hold until expiry.

I wonder what is the better option then?

From my guess:

1. I should choose option which has less IV? 

2. If both have similar IV, I should choose option 2 because stock gains have better tax treatment?

Title: DOJ explaining why you should invest in Visa 
Text
 Excerpt is from their lawsuit against V


5. As a result, debit networks face what Visa calls "a chicken-and-egg problem." To be successful, the network needs many issuers and acquirers to accept the network. But issuers are unlikely to join the debit network unless many merchants already use the network. And merchants are unlikely to join the network unless their customers have cards that work with the network, which requires the issuer to have activated the network. As Visa itself observes, "build[ing] scale on both sides... with consumers/payers and with merchants/payees" is "a herculean task." Visa further recognizes that these effects create "an enormous moat" around its business.

6. Visa's market shares demonstrate just how deep that moat is. Visa has been the largest debit network in the United States for decades. Today, over 60% of all U.S. debit transactions run via Visa's payments network. And Visa's share of card-not-present debit transactions exceeds 65%. Mastercard is a distant second, processing less than 25% of all U.S. debit transactions and card-not-present U.S. debit transactions. Other networks, known as "PIN networks" because they originally facilitated ATM transactions for which accountholders needed to enter a PIN, are significantly smaller.

7. This moat is no accident. Coming out of the Great Recession, Visa identified two significant threats to its monopoly—one from legislation and one from emerging technology. Visa took steps to counter both, enriching itself handsomely in the process.

Title: Why Did Biogen’s Stock Drop Despite Strong Earnings and Analyst Upgrades (Aug 2024)?
Text
 I’m trying to understand why Biogen’s stock dropped right after its \*August 2024 earnings call\*, even though the company reported strong numbers, raised guidance, and received multiple analyst upgrades. All the indicators—company performance, analysts, and earnings—were positive, so why did the market seem to ignore these and push the stock down?

To be clear, I'm not looking to debate trading vs. investing strategies or the randomness of the stock market. My question is straightforward: given that both the company and the analysts seemed to signal "buy" or "hold," why did the market make an independent decision to sell?

Looking for some insights here, so if you don’t know or just want to yell ‘market’s random,’ kindly move along without blowing my mind. If anyone can provide insights on why this happened that’d be appreciated.

Thanks!

Title: Would the implementation of 24/5 trading at NYSE have implications for options and theta in general?
Text
 It’s already public news that the NYSE is setting forth the agenda of creating 22hr/day trading as a result of tensions from Robinhood’s trading hours. 

The question begets, let me preface this by saying I am in no means an options expert or have my toes dipped deep in the realms of options trading in general, but the natural question that arises from such an implementation would ultimately be - how does this affect option pricing and trading in general?

Currently, non-fut options are being traded from 9:30-5PM EST, that is a timespan of ~7-8 hours a day. Technically, if I’m able to trade options for 3x the duration, what would the underlying implications of this be in terms of delta and theta variances? There was always an implicit understanding that MMs would price options on Friday for next week with Sat/Sun theta in mind.

Just curious on your takes for the future options trading environment, and if there are any possible strategies to take note of in the future.

Title: COST, when will Costco split?
Text
 52 week high of $923.83, low of $540.23. Currently at $891.

P/E at 53% -- pretty high, but they are consistently growing, and growing at a consistent pace, 31 per year. Three states don't have a Costco, (now that they have one in Little Rock!!!!!) Rhode Island, West Virginia, and Wyoming -- wouldn't fit their model.

up 37% YTD, up 200% over the past 5 years.

Sales, revenue, all up year over year -- consistently. 2020 net income was 4 Billion, 2024 is on track for 7.3 Billion. Nearly double in four years.

Hasn't split in 25 years and gained 2780% since that split.

Their dividends are meek, except when they do special dividends (last one was $15/share in Dec '23). Current dividends are at $1.16 and they go up every year (four and up). So they should be considered a dividend aristocrat I suppose, except those special dividends kind of throw off the calculation.

I know that a split doesn't change the valuation of the company, just that it makes the stock more affordable to the average investor.

Title: What’s the stock you’ll never sell
Text
 Our investment philosophy and goals usually depend on our age. You probably wouldn’t accept the same risk at 20 than at 60, especially if your stock portfolio is part of your retirement plan.

I agree with a value investing philosophy, so to me never selling implies the original investment thesis doesn’t change. 

I think we could have an interesting discussion if we share our age (or age range) and the company in which we trust for the rest of our lives (and why).

I’m in my 30s, so assuming I live for the next 50 years, I believe Lockheed Martin ($LMT) will remain an important player in the defense sector, as I expect war (mostly proxy wars) to continue being used for political interests and if the US DoD sees its budget reduced, our current Western society’s paradigm will be over.

Other candidates I’ve considered are Visa ($V), Microsoft ($MSFT) and Amazon ($AMZN), but I could see all those titans being disrupted someday in the next 50 years.

 Hi everyone,

Finviz screener question~ 


I keep seeing a lot of setups for potential long plays and short squeezes around here, but I’m curious about the flip side.

What indicators or setups do you look for when identifying good short or put candidates? I’m wondering about the best signals that suggest a stock could see a decline.

Are there any specific technical indicators, chart patterns, or fundamental red flags that tend to give you the green light? Or maybe particular market conditions that you feel make a short play more likely to pay off?

Any insights or setups you rely on would be awesome! Thanks in advance.

Title: Why Cancel shares instead of convert to Treasury shares during Buyback?
Text
 Greetings, when a company does share buybacks (i.e. share repurchase), my understanding is that it must either cancel those shares or hold them as treasury shares.

  
Why would a company cancel the shares as opposed to holding onto them as treasury shares?

  
My limited thinking would be that converting them to treasury shares would be better as: (1) the company would retain the ability to reissue them at a later date, (2) the company would limit outside ownership (e.g. prevent hostile takeover), and (3) the company would still retain the ability to always cancel the shares in the future.

* P/e and forward p/e of 2.6

* PEG of 0.22

* P/B of 0.63

* Dividend of 7%

* Dividend payout ratio of 18%

* Profit margin of 45%

* Free cash flow is fine



The greatest fault I can find is that its debt/equity ratio is high at 0.54 and it has issued a fair amount of long term debt recently. 

Despite strong operational performance, it's shown mediocre share performance. Over the last 10 years, it's had an annual return of only 1.6% including dividend reinvestment.

Conversely, the last 5 years would return 32% annually. 

It seems like it tanked in the 2015-16 selloff and never recovered. Yet today it's operating very profitably.

Why is this stock valued so lowly? 

What is the catch?

Title: Texas Roadhouse, Inc. Announces Third Quarter 2024 Results
Text
 Results for the 13 weeks ended September 24, 2024, as compared to the prior year as applicable, included the following:

Comparable restaurant sales increased 8.5% at company restaurants and increased 7.2% at domestic franchise restaurants

Average weekly sales at company restaurants were $149,176 of which $18,914 were to-go sales as compared to average weekly sales of $138,668 of which $17,058 were to-go sales in the prior year

Restaurant margin dollars increased 24.1% to $202.1 million from $162.8 million in the prior year primarily due to higher sales. Restaurant margin, as a percentage of restaurant and other sales, increased to 16.0% from 14.6% in the prior year driven primarily by higher sales. The benefit of a higher average guest check and improved labor productivity more than offset wage and other labor inflation of 4.7% and commodity inflation of 1.3%

Diluted earnings per share increased 32.5% primarily driven by higher restaurant margin dollars partially offset by higher general and administrative expenses and higher depreciation and amortization expenses

Seven company restaurants and three franchise restaurants were opened

Capital allocation spend included capital expenditures of $91.1 million, dividends of $40.7 million, and repurchases of common stock of $9.6 million.

Jerry Morgan, Chief Executive Officer of Texas Roadhouse, Inc. commented, “We are extremely pleased in such a competitive environment to report another quarter of continued traffic growth at each of our brands. This is a credit to the hard work of our operators who create an environment where Roadies want to work and guests want to dine.”

Morgan continued, “Looking ahead to 2025, we once again have a strong development pipeline and as of today already have 10 of our new company restaurants under construction. We remain confident that this new store growth along with our planned franchise acquisition and overall capital allocation strategy will allow us to continue to generate long-term shareholder value.”

The Company has tentatively agreed to acquire 13 domestic franchise restaurants with a targeted close date as of the beginning of our 2025 fiscal year. These acquisitions are subject to the completion of customary negotiations and due diligence.

Title: 75 people affected in E. coli outbreak linked to McDonald's Quarter Pounders: CDC
Text
 A deadly E. coli outbreak linked to McDonald’s Quarter Pounders has led to 75 cases in 13 states, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday, as it investigates the source of the spread. 

The outbreak has led to 22 hospitalizations and one previously reported death of an older adult in Colorado.

Out of 61 patients with information available, 22 have been hospitalized and two people have developed a serious condition that can cause kidney failure, called hemolytic uremic syndrome. All of the 42 people who were interviewed by the CDC reported eating at McDonald’s, while 39 people reported eating a beef hamburger, the agency said.

Those with infections ranged between ages 13 and 88, according to the CDC. The agency reiterated that the number of cases in the outbreak is likely much higher than what has been reported so far. The CDC added that the outbreak may not be limited to the states with related cases. That is because many patients do not test for E. coli and recover from an infection without receiving medical care, the CDC said. It also usually takes three to four weeks to determine if a sick person is part of an outbreak.

Shares of the restaurant chain fell 2% on the update. The stock is down 6% since the CDC announced the outbreak on Tuesday, initially citing 49 cases and one death across 10 states.

McDonald’s declined to comment on the update, citing the company’s statement when the outbreak was first announced.

Quarter Pounder hamburgers are a core menu item for McDonald’s, raking in billions of dollars annually.

Health officials are closely examining the slivered onions used in the Quarter Pounder as a likely contaminant. McDonald’s has instructed restaurants in the affected area to remove slivered onions from their supply, and has paused the distribution of that ingredient in the region.

McDonald’s stores in Colorado, Kansas, Utah, Wyoming as well as parts of Idaho, Iowa, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico and Oklahoma have temporarily stopped using Quarter Pounder slivered onions and beef patties, according to the CDC.

McDonald’s identified California-based produce giant Taylor Farms as the supplier for the sliced onions the company removed from its supply chain. Taylor Farms has issued a recall on four raw onion products due to potential E. coli contamination. Burger King, Pizza Hut, KFC and Taco Bell have pulled onions from select restaurants in response to the outbreak.

But federal agencies are also investigating the Quarter Pounder’s beef patty as a potential culprit.

As the CDC and other federal agencies trace cases and work to contain the outbreak, McDonald’s has pulled Quarter Pounders from restaurants in the affected areas. Around a fifth of McDonald’s U.S. restaurants are not selling Quarter Pounder burgers.

McDonald’s spokespeople said Wednesday that it is too early to tell if the outbreak is having any effect on traffic to its restaurants.

The company is expected to report its third-quarter earnings on Tuesday and could share more details with investors about the situation on the conference call.

The outbreak comes after several quarters of sluggish U.S. sales for McDonald’s. Price-sensitive consumers have not been visiting restaurants as much, leading McDonald’s and other fast-food chains to turn to value meals to boost sales. Wall Street analysts are expecting the company to report U.S. same-store sales growth of 0.5% for the third quarter, according to StreetAccount estimates.

For now, McDonald’s is trying to reassure customers that its menu items are safe to eat and drink and that it is taking the outbreak seriously. Experts told CNBC that barring a more serious crisis, the damage to its brand may be minimal, as with an E. coli outbreak linked to Wendy’s two years ago.

Title: NYSE plans to extend daily trading to 22 hours on its Arca exchange
Text
 [https://www.ft.com/content/59dc109d-d385-412a-bcc6-b671db9ce680](https://www.ft.com/content/59dc109d-d385-412a-bcc6-b671db9ce680)

&gt;The New York Stock Exchange announced plans to extend trading hours for equities on its Arca venue to 22 hours on weekdays, in an effort to meet global demand for buying and selling US-listed assets around the clock. NYSE, which is part of Intercontinental Exchange, said the extended trading hours for its all-electronic Arca exchange would cover 1:30am to 11:30pm Eastern time, excluding holidays. The proposed expansion, which targets a 2025 launch and is subject to approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission, follows the increased popularity in recent years of round-the-clock retail trading offered via brokerage platforms such as Robinhood and Interactive Brokers. “As the steward of the US capital markets, the NYSE is pleased to lead the way in enabling exchange-based trading for our US-listed companies and funds to investors in time zones across the globe,” Kevin Tyrrell, head of markets at the NYSE, said in a statement on Friday. NYSE plans to seek regulatory approval for the extended trading hours from the SEC as well as “US securities information processors”, such as the Consolidated Tape Association. The “tape” represents the official record of trading prices on exchanges, so the inclusion of night-time activity would be more likely to set the early tone for regular trading hours. NYSE Arca is best known as a venue for exchange traded funds and also hosts certain stocks and closed-end funds. Year-to-date, the Arca exchange has traded about $27.7bn a day in ETFs and about $21.8bn per day in corporate stocks, according to NYSE. It already has a broader operating window than the NYSE itself, with sessions running from 4am to 8pm Eastern time. Regular NYSE trading hours are 9.30am to 4pm Eastern time. Retail trading has boomed as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic and the increased salience of cryptocurrencies. Assets such as US Treasuries, currencies and stock index futures can already be traded outside of normal exchange hours. That trend has put pressure on NYSE to consider widening its trading hours, and earlier this year prompted the group to poll market participants on the merits of trading stocks around the clock. Some retail brokers already offer 24/7 trading where trades overnight are matched through a “dark pool” venue that matches night-time trades in the US with daytime buying and selling in Asia.

**Tl;dr:** NYSE Arca wants to change its trading hours from currently **4am - 8pm** to **1:30am - 11:30pm**. Needs SEC approval.

Title: Mizuho raises SoFi's target price to $14 from $12 before Earnings.
Text
 I found this in Reuters U.S. RESEARCH ROUNDUP publication from today at 7:13:01 AM ET.

SoFi is getting a lot of attention regarding earnings adjustments and price targets even before this 3rd quarter's earnings.

The institutions appear to be loading up before this earnings and they probably will publish more positive outlooks and price targets once they finish loading up and after this upcoming Q3 earnings scheduled to be announced on Tuesday, Oct 29th at 7 AM ET.

JMHO, I predict that SoFi's EPS will probably be $0.06 with an upbeat outlook.

Title: Killam Apartment REIT (KMP-UN.TO) residential reit below book value
Text
 Hey all,

Hoping someone may have some insight as to why this residential reit trades below book value with decreasing share price even with an environment I would think tends to favor residential real estate. Lowering of interest rates in Canada mixed with my worry of inflation forecast leaned me towards residential REIT.

They are in expansion mode quickly building/buying new condominium, revenue is up every year, property NOI growth exceeds 8%, the bulk of their portfolio lies in a favorable area for real estate, debt is under control, etc. Every metric leads me to believe this company is doing well &amp; will continue to do so.

So why would the share price not reflect that, I'm no smarter than the next guy although I work directly with stocks (though within the consumer sector) I do not have any insight on REIT's and my real estate knowledge is extremely limited.

They also dominate in one of Canada's fastest growing cities in term of sheer presence &amp; occupancy.

I have yet to do a deep dive on an exact share price but obviously trading below book value when everything seems good is highly unusual to me. I'd expect a company trading that low to have something terribly wrong or stronger headwinds within its business.

Here is their latest investor presentation. If anyone with a deeper understanding of REIT/overall restate within Atlantic Canada (note: geographical risk greatly reduced)

 These were chosen out of a pretty much unfiltered list (all US stocks &gt;100M market cap) one by one.

# *Selection criteria:*



1. The first rounds of filtering were based on the overall trend of revenue growth over 20, 10, &amp; 5 years. All must be positive

2. The second round is based on the actual current size of revenue &amp; total equity growth. Generally it must be at least +30% rev &amp; eq combined

3. Third round, consistency. Any "weird" financials, inconsistencies are tossed

4. Soft fourth for value, taking into account PEG and other price:financial metrics

5. Fifth leaves us with around 50. Sorted by the criteria above, keep top 10.

Title: When/how do you know it's time to sell your successful stock?
Text
 Hey. When it comes to huge companies, like Amazon, Nvidia and others, it's obvious you can and should keep their stocks when they give you significant profits, say, 11% in a month (unless there is something obvious that could crumble them ofc). 

But what about smaller companies that ppl find full of potential? I bought Celestica Inc. (CLS) stocks like a month ago. It's already given me about 15% (after yesterday's strong earnings report). I read articles where this company is stated promising etc, but I'd like to know when it is the best time to sell. 

It may rise even more which could lead to a lost profit for me, but what's the common strategy in such cases?

Title: Tesla stock has best day in over a decade on Musk's 2025 growth projection
Text
 Tesla shares soared 22% to close at $260.48 on Thursday, the stock’s best day since 2013, following the company’s better-than-expected earnings report.

The company late Wednesday reported revenue of $25.18 billion, which came in just under analysts’ expectations of $25.37 billion, but was up 8% compared with a year earlier. Tesla reported earnings per share of 72 cents adjusted, topping the average analyst estimate of 58 cents.

“We expect this surprising earnings beat to power a strong positive reaction in Tesla shares Thursday, given the degree to which investors have become conditioned to earnings misses from the company,” analysts at JPMorgan wrote in a note.

Tesla’s profit margins in the third quarter were boosted by $739 million in revenue for environmental regulatory credits, which the JPMorgan analysts noted were a “potentially unsustainable driver” of earnings and cash flow.

Automakers are required to obtain a certain amount of regulatory credits every year, and if they can’t meet the target, they can buy credits from other companies. Tesla has excess credits because it only makes electric vehicles.

Tesla earnings also got a boost from FSD, the company’s Full Self-Driving Supervised system. CFO Vaibhav Taneja said on the earnings call that FSD contributed $326 million in revenue in the quarter after Tesla made it available for use in the Cybertruck and added a feature called “Actually Smart Summon.”

CEO Elon Musk said on the call that his “best guess” is that “vehicle growth” will reach 20% to 30% next year, citing “lower cost vehicles” and the “advent of autonomy.” Analysts surveyed by FactSet were expecting delivery growth of about 15% for 2025.

Even bullish Deutsche Bank analysts doubted Musk’s forecast and wrote, in a note following the earnings report, “Our view remains more reserved at 10-15% (~2.03m),” and assumes Tesla can roll out a cheaper version of its Model Y at a price under $30,000 after subsidies, and other variants of the small SUV.

Analysts at Morgan Stanley who also recommend buying the stock, called Musk’s 2025 vehicle delivery growth prediction a “maybe.” They set their estimate at 14%.

It “clearly depends on the company’s ability to improve affordability through cheaper model (next gen) introduction, financing offers and improved features,” the Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a note Thursday.

A grain of salt

Musk said on the Wednesday call that Tesla plans to start production of its recently unveiled Cybercab, a robotaxi with butterfly doors and no steering wheel or pedals, by the end of 2026. He also said Tesla would conduct driverless ridehailing in California and Texas next year in its existing cars, which are not currently safe to use without a human driver ready to steer or brake at any time.

Bernstein analysts, who have a bearish price target of $120 on shares of Tesla, wrote in a note out Thursday: “The tone of Tesla’s conference call was ebullient and filled with Musk prognostications that have historically polarized bull and bear investors, and was more akin to a pep rally, with the company only taking two questions from sell-siders.”

Musk has for years promised shareholders a software upgrade that can turn Teslas into robotaxis. That hasn’t happened yet. Musk has also promised a refreshed version of the Tesla Roadster since 2017. The design of the vehicle is not yet complete. 

The Bernstein analysts wrote, “We continue to struggle to see Tesla overcoming the technological and regulatory hurdles needed to leapfrog current level 4 robotaxis, and believe fully unsupervised FSD could be years away.”

They pointed to Musk’s “long history of being overly optimistic about FSD” and said crowdsourced research that shows “Tesla continues to lag well behind competitors” on robotaxis.

The share rally Thursday was the sharpest since a 24% gain in May 2013. The jump erased Tesla’s loss for the year and left the stock up 3% in 2024, though it still trails the 22% gain for the Nasdaq.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS &amp; revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

Title: Europe's top court rules for Intel to end long-running antitrust case
Text
 BRUSSELS, Oct 24 (Reuters) - The EU Court of Justice, Europe's top court, ruled on Thursday in favour of Intel, opens new tab, ending a nearly two-decade-long fight between the U.S. chipmaker and EU regulators who had said it had tried to thwart a rival.

"The Court of Justice dismisses the Commission’s appeal, thereby upholding the judgment of the General Court," the court said.

Title: CAVA Expansion Continues - Midwest Expansion Spotlight 
Text
 I will start this by saying I am probably too obsessed with CAVA. I have known the Company since 2017 and hold 550 shares with a $49 avg basis. 

Being in the greater Detroit area I can only get CAVA when I travel out east for business. This, I say with great enthusiasm, is about to change. Through meticulous stalking of CAVA’s job postings, I have discovered that it is the Company’s intention to expand from their initial  entry in the Midwest market (Chicago) to both the Indianapolis and Detroit areas.

The timeline is uncertain, but if I were to guess, there could be up to four store locations around each city by YE 2025.

CAVA has had enormous success since their summer 2023 IPO (up 208%). The Company has around 330 locations across 28 states, with a stated goal of 1000 locations by 2032. There are concerns from some that the Company is currently way overvalued, while others contend that the market is only pricing in some of the growth and white space ahead. Regardless, I am very much looking forward to having this option near me. 

Cheers!

Title: Is $SMR facing badluck or it will eventually breakthough?
Text
 Badluck

1. This past November, the Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems, or UAMPS, terminated what was to be “the first NuScale Power small modular reactor plant to begin operation in the United States.” This was a death foretold; the red flags have been obvious for years now.

https://www.utilitydive.com/news/nuscale-uamps-project-small-modular-reactor-ramanasmr-/705717/

2. NuScale also didn't make the final cut to build SMR in the UK

&gt;US company eliminated from race to build Britain’s first mini-nuclear plant

https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2024/09/25/us-firm-eliminated-from-race-build-britain-first-mini-nuke/

The naysayers are stating due to unproven technology, nobody wants to be the 1st guinea pig.  It is costly upfront and if something goes wrong they might be on hook in fines and penalties (hazardous material handling).

But this said... recently, the Biden admin has greenlit financial assistance approval for nuclear energy related projects.  

China and Russia already have approved SMRs and I believe they have a few already up and running.  

The unfairness is that - their gov't can absorb the costs if something goes wrong. 

Questions

1. Why doesn't the US gov't go a little deeper into the projects and bear some of the costs/potential dangers associated with it? 

2. Big companies like Amazon and Google have signed up partnerships with energy companies for SMR to be designed/built.  Why don't they just partner with a company like NuScale instead (approved SMR design)?

At the end of day, in 10 years... if energy infrastructure stays the way it is - the US could be way behind Russia/China in terms of energy source/efficienct. Nevermind inability to power many data centers etc. and not ability to meet its clean energy goals. 

Thoughts?

Title: How can I report capital loss on a stock when it's untradeable so I can't sell?
Text
 On Robinhood I have TLGTQ that almost went bankruptcy 3 years ago or so and now the price is $0.0002.

I had $1,000 worth of it but now value is $0 so I want to report a loss of $1,000 but since I can't sell it, Robinhood can't send me form 1099..

What can i do?

2nd question is, in whatever fiscal year this becomes tradeable and I sell and have $1,000 capital loss, does it still lower my total taxable income by $1,000 for tax filing even if I dont have any other capital gains from other stocks? (Meaning no other stock selling activities in that fiscal year other than loss from this TLGTQ stock)

Hope this makes sense and hope to get your advice.. thanks!

 Stock is down 20% today after releasing news that the efficacy of their therapy matches existing options. For long term investors with a large appetite for risk, this may be a great investment opportunity. While efficacy is only incrementally better, this is a one time treatment. Competitors require regular infusions every four weeks. Two large questions remain: will it pass phase 3 trials and can they execute on commercialization strategy/ patient acquisition.

Title: Tesla shares jump 6% on profit beat
Text
 * Tesla reported third-quarter earnings on Wednesday that topped analysts’ estimates even as revenue came in just shy of expectations.

Here’s what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

* **Earnings per share:** 72 cents vs. 58 cents expected
* **Revenue:** $25.18 billion vs. $25.37 billion expected

Revenue increased 8% in the quarter from $23.35 billion a year earlier. Net income rose to about $2.17 billion, or 62 cents a share, from $1.85 billion, or 53 cents s share, a year ago.

Tesla’s profit margins were bolstered by $739 million in automotive regulatory credit revenue during the quarter. The company has also been offering an array of discounts and incentives to spur sales.

Automotive revenue increased 2% to $20 billion from $19.63 billion in the same period a year earlier. Energy generation and storage revenue soared 52% to $2.38 billion, while services and other revenue jumped 29% to $2.79 billion.

Operating margin was reported at 10.8% of sales to improve from last quarter's mark of 6.3%, and top last year's mark of 7.6%. Total GAAP gross margin was 19.8% vs. 17.9% a year ago and 18.0% in the prior quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $4.67 billion vs. $3.76 billion a year ago. For the quarter, the EV juggernaut's adjusted EBITDA margin rose to 18.5% of sales from 16.1% a year ago.

# 

Tesla had already disclosed 462,890 deliveries for Q3. The electric vehicle maker said it produced 469,796 vehicles during the quarter. Tesla noted that 3% of the deliveries were subject to operating lease accounting. For reference, Tesla delivered 443,956 vehicles in Q2 of this year and 435,059 vehicles in Q3 of last year. Tesla's  all-time deliveries record was 484,507 vehicles in Q4 of 2023. Looking ahead, Tesla reiterated that plans for new vehicles, including more affordable models, remain on track for start of production in the first half of 2025.

# More than just EVs

Tesla said energy storage deployments decreased sequentially in Q3 to a record 6.9 GWh, but were up 75% Y/Y. Overall, Tesla said energy services and other businesses are becoming increasingly profitable parts of the company. "As energy storage products continue to ramp, and our vehicle fleet continues to grow, we are expecting continued profit growth from these businesses over time," noted TSLA. The company also said that it deployed and is training ahead of schedule on a 29k H100 cluster at Gigafactory Texas, where it expects to have 50k H100 capacity by the end of October.

# Balance sheet

Tesla ended the quarter with a cash position of $33.6 billion. The sequential increase of $2.9 billion was a result of positive free cash flow of $2.7 billion. Operating cash flow was $6.3 billion during the quarter.

**SUMMARY**

We delivered strong results in Q3 with growth in vehicle deliveries both sequentially and year-on-year, resulting in record third-quarter volumes. We also recognized our second-highest quarter of regulatory credit revenues as other OEMs are still behind on meeting emissions requirements.

Our cost of goods sold (COGS) per vehicle came down to its lowest level ever at \~$35,100. In order to continue accelerating the world’s transition to sustainable energy, we need to make EVs affordable for everyone, including making total cost of ownership per mile competitive with all forms of transportation. Preparations remain underway for our offering of new vehicles – including more affordable models – which we will begin launching in the first half of 2025. At our "We, Robot" event on October 10, we detailed our long-term goal of offering autonomous transport with a cost per mile below rideshare, personal car ownership, and even public transit.

The Energy business achieved another strong quarter with a record gross margin. Additionally, the Megafactory in Lathrop produced 200 Megapacks in a week, and Powerwall deployments reached a record for the second quarter in a row as we continue to ramp Powerwall 3.

Despite sustained macroeconomic headwinds and others pulling back on EV investments, we remain focused on expanding our vehicle and energy product lineup, reducing costs and making critical investments in AI projects and production capacity. We believe these efforts will allow us to capitalize on the ongoing transition in the transportation and energy sectors.

Title: tax harvesting question 
Text
 in 2023 tax year I had $10,000 in stock losses. I used $3,000 last year to bring down my taxable income and am able to carryover $7000 (but use only $3000) this year 2024. This year, I have some stocks that I can sell for a gain (if I sell all, total gain is about $12,000). Should I sell it to meet the $3000 limit so I will not have to pay taxes on that $3000 gain that I made and I can maximize the benefit of the $3000/y carryover? Does it make a difference if I use it toward this stock gain vs bringing down my taxable income? Am I understanding this correctly?

Title: Nvidia supplier SK Hynix posts record Q3 profit, beats forecasts
Text
 SEOUL (Reuters) -South Korea's SK Hynix on Thursday posted a record quarterly profit as the Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) supplier saw strong sales of its advanced chips such as high bandwidth memory (HBM) ones used in generative AI chipsets.

The world's second-biggest memory chipmaker reported a 7 trillion won ($5.07 billion) operating profit for the July-September quarter versus a 1.8 trillion won loss a year earlier.

That compared with a 6.8 trillion won average forecast by LSEG SmartEstimate, which is weighted toward analysts who are more consistently accurate.

SK Hynix has outperformed rivals Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) and Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) in recent quarters, as it has benefited the most from AI-driven appetite for high-end memory chips following its early entry and large investments in HBM chip development.

"HBM sales showed excellent growth, up more than 70% from the previous quarter and more than 330% from the same period last year," SK Hynix said in a statement.

SK Hynix sees HBM sales making up 40% of its total DRAM revenue in the fourth quarter, up from 30% in the third quarter, and added it expects memory chip demand for AI servers to grow further next year as global tech companies continue developing generative AI.

Revenue for the quarter rose 94% year-on-year to 17.6 trillion won.

SK Hynix shares have jumped 38.5% so far this year, outperforming Samsung, whose stocks has slumped 24.7% over the same period.

Last month, SK Hynix, the main supplier of HBM chips to Nvidia, said it had started mass production of HBM3E 12-layer chips and plans to supply the latest products to unidentified customers by the end of this year.

 There were bets on the stock going either way on earnings, but nobody predicted such a decisive beat on auto gross margins and EPS. For the first time in almost 3 years, the pump is halfway justified by fundamentals.

Title: Earnings Database that auto-updates
Text
 First off, if anyone knows of a service that provides the above, LMK. Earnings Whisper might, but whether they include screen pics of the price action of previous quarters, I do not know.

Secondly, I've created my own record of earnings behaviors over a couple of years of quarters. Each folder named after the stock ticker includes screenshots of past earnings behaviors. Thing is, I can not stand to move the folders every quarterly cycle. It's a lot of tedious work. Yes I could stick to a selection but I'm ambitious. 

Many hit the same day of the week of the quarter, but most do not hit the exact same day. Can anyone think of the best approach that I could keep these folders, but they would auto update to the upcoming date of the earnings? Maybe I need to put these folders in a calendar that can suck in data. Schwab TOS has a good calendar. I wish I could dump my folders of screenpics into an extension of their calendar.

I know Google sheets has stock ticker data that autofills price. I don't know if coming earnings date is a field that auto updates. If it did, I assume I could dump my entire folder into that google sheets folder MAYBE.

Thanks!

 * The SEC accused Ryan Choi of "negligently engaging in a scheme to defraud" the readers of Citron Research in connection with two social media posts with recommendations to buy two US stocks.
* Choi agreed to pay $1.8 million to the SEC to settle the charges.
* The settlement is likely to be a blow to Andrew Left, an activist short seller and the founder of Citron Research who is fighting SEC and Department of Justice charges filed in July alleging he engaged in a scheme to defraud Citron Research followers by publishing false and misleading statements regarding his stock trading recommendations.
* The authorities in Los Angeles claimed Andrew Left generated at least $16 million in illegal trading profits through stock manipulation. Prosecutors and regulators accused him of using his fame to tell investors to do one thing while he traded the other way.
* The SEC called it a “bait and switch” strategy.  Mr. Left apparently bought back stock immediately after telling his readers to sell, and he sold stocks immediately after telling his readers to buy.
* Federal prosecutors claim Mr. Left used exaggerated language in his commentary and manipulated stock prices with his social media posts.

Revenue performance included 10% growth in price/mix and a 2% decline in concentrate sales. Concentrate sales were 1 point behind unit case volume, primarily due to the timing of concentrate shipments.

**Full Year 2024**

For comparable net revenues (non-GAAP), the company expects a 4% to 5% headwind from acquisitions, divestitures and structural changes. Comparable EPS (non-GAAP) is expected to include a 1% to 2% headwind from acquisitions, divestitures and structural changes. — No Update

The company expects to deliver comparable currency neutral EPS (non-GAAP) growth of 14% to 15%. — Updated

The company expects comparable EPS (non-GAAP) growth of 5% to 8%, versus $2.69 in 2023. — No Update

The company expects to generate free cash flow excluding the IRS tax litigation deposit (non-GAAP) of approximately $9.2 billion.

**Fourth Quarter 2024 Considerations** 

Comparable net revenues (non-GAAP) are expected to include an approximate 4% currency headwind based on the current rates and including the impact of hedged positions, in addition to a 4% to 5% headwind from acquisitions, divestitures and structural changes.

**Full Year 2025 Considerations**

Comparable net revenues (non-GAAP) are expected to include a low single-digit currency headwind based on the current rates and including the impact of hedged positions.

  
Key Takeaways:

Organic sales shine again Organic revenue rose 11% during the quarter vs a 9.3% consensus estimate, with unit case volume up +2% and Latin America up +12%. The organic sales growth outpaced PepsiCo's 9.3% mark in a recently completed period. Unit case volume was down 1% for Coca-Cola globally during the quarter, with growth led by Brazil, the Philippines and Japan but more than offset by declines in China and Türkiye.

Title: Why is $MSTR (Microstrategy) market cap more than 2x its asset value if it's an asset driven (Bitcoin) stock?
Text
 At $67,000 and holding 244,800 Bitcoin as of September 2024, Microstrategy holds over $16B of Bitcoin. This does not account for its debt or any value from its software business.

Why is the market cap of Microstrategy based on its current share price more than 2x the value of its Bitcoin holdings? How do you compute Microstrategy value?

Can't argue with results, it went up over 100% since September 2024.

Title: Starbucks shares slide after preliminary results show sales fell again
Text
 Starbucks on Tuesday posted preliminary quarterly results, which showed its sales fell again.

Nearly two months ago, CEO Brian Niccol took the helm of the coffee giant after two quarters of same-store sales declines.

He aims to reverse slowing demand for Starbucks’ drinks, particularly in its two largest markets: the United States and China. In the U.S., the chain has been losing its occasional customers, who have opted to save money instead of spending on its macchiatos and Refreshers. Starbucks’ business in China has also been struggling to recover ever since the pandemic, and the rise of cheaper local rivals like Luckin Coffee and a more cautious consumer have dented sales in recent months.

Niccol joined Starbucks after six years as CEO of Chipotle; during his tenure at the fast-casual chain, he led the company through a turnaround after its foodborne illness crises, invested in its digital business and turned it into a top industry performer, even during the pandemic.

To curb Starbucks’ sales slump, Niccol plans to turn first to the company’s struggling U.S. business. In an open letter released during his first week on the job, he said he plans to focus on four areas of improvement: the barista experience, morning service, its cafes and the company’s branding.

Niccol has also been reshuffling the company’s executive ranks. On Friday, the company announced a former Chipotle executive, Tressie Lieberman, will be joining Starbucks as its global chief brand officer, a newly created position. And last month, Starbucks said its North American CEO Michael Conway would retire after just five months in the role; Niccol’s predecessor Laxman Narasimhan had appointed Conway before his ouster in August.

Shares of Starbucks are up 1% this year, as of Tuesday’s close. The company has a market cap of more than $109 billion.

The company is expected to report its fiscal-fourth quarter earnings after the bell on Oct. 30.

Title: Three stocks that you feel will outperform the market over the next 5 years
Text
 Like the title says: which three stocks, individual equities, do you believe will outperform the market, Market Index Funds: VOO, ONEQ, or DIA?

My takes:

COST -- Costco has a great expansion model, a great business model, and loyalty like few other companies: customer, employee, and vendors.

AAPL -- I continue to see them innovate, they won't stick with something that isn't working, and their stuff just works.

Third slot is a bit tougher: GOOG, NVDA, or JPM in that order.

Title: Lockheed Martin Stock Sinks as F-35 Sales Decline Weighs on Revenue
Text
 Lockheed Martin (LMT) shares tumbled Tuesday as the defense contractor missed revenue estimates on a drop in aerospace sales.

The company reported third-quarter revenue rose 1% year-over-year to $17.10 billion, while analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha were looking for $17.38 billion. Earnings per share (EPS) of $6.80 exceeded forecasts.

Lockheed's Aeronautics unit sales declined 3% to $6.49 billion, primarily because of delays in contractual authorization and funding for the F-35 fighter jet. Sales at its Space division were down less than 1% to $3.08 billion. Missiles and Fire Control segment revenue jumped 8% to $3.18 billion, and Rotary and Mission Systems unit revenue was 6% higher at $4.37 billion.

The company raised its full-year EPS outlook to $26.65 from a range of $26.10 to $26.60, and narrowed its revenue outlook to $71.25 billion from the previous $70.50 billion to $71.50 billion. 

Shares of Lockheed Martin hit an all-time high yesterday, and even with today's roughly 5% declines they're up nearly 30% year-to-date.

Title: Tesla’s Not a Car Company, Musk’s in the Business of Selling the Future. And 5 Other Things to Know Today.
Text
 

It may surprise some to learn that Tesla isn’t really in the car business.

Sure, some 80% of its revenue currently comes from electric vehicles. And CEO Elon Musk is pretty good at squeezing profit out of those cars—something many in the industry still haven’t managed to figure out.

But the most important thing to know about the company is that it trades on more than 70 times forward earnings. Ford and General Motors are on five or six times. This suggests that when investors buy Tesla stock, their expectations are in a different universe from when they buy into other car makers.

Musk is pulling old-school levers to ensure his cars are profitable, even as rivals churn out lower-cost models. It helps that Tesla can now make more vehicles from the same manufacturing base and squeeze suppliers to cushion margins.

At the same time, a closer look at the earnings yesterday—which beat Wall Street estimates—show Tesla’s profits come from plenty of other sources. It made money from software, from selling regulatory credits for making more than its share of zero-emission cars, and from battery storage and charging.

Of course, robotaxis and self-driving cars are the next frontier. They’re not really cars—the robotaxi won’t even have a steering wheel or pedals. They are a bet on technology and artificial intelligence, not the automotive industry. It’s why Tesla is one of Nvidia’s best customers.

There’s a story about Ray Kroc, the businessman who made McDonald’s the most successful fast-food corporation, and the value of knowing exactly what business you’re really in. For McDonald’s, it’s real estate, not hamburgers.

Elon Musk knows he’s not in the car business. He’s selling the future. The tricky part will be delivering on his promises when expectations are already so high.

 NVDA is now over 50% of my portfolio, with 900% gains since I bought it a few years back.

This makes me uncomfortable, I would like to diversify and spread my risk out a bit to other stocks / ETFs. 

NVDA is sitting in a regular brokerage account currently, so if I sell any portion of it I would be subject to long term capital gains. I also have a 401k and a Roth IRA. Are there any creative ways to shift the stock over to those portfolios to save on tax?

Title: Plantir Opinions from Technical People who actually use it

 All the hype about this stock must be from people who don't understand the technology. What they are doing isn't magic, and can be done with less vendor lock-in by a number of other cloud technologies. Palantir is just good at selling a pipe dream to the C-suite. 

As Scott Galloway mentioned, this company is more similar to Microstrategy (excluding their Bitcoin stuff ) than other companies.

Title: Thoughts on OKLO?

 This is a nuclear energy co. that Sam Altman initially seed funded. Price went up over 100% in past 5 days ($9 to $22) after increased interest in AI turning to nuclear energy sources. The company looks good and is/was close to having a contract with the Air Force and has received permits to build in ID . But Cathie Wood sold her shares today, (and bought shares in another NE co. - BWXT) and price dropped to $20 but was as low as $18.50. Do you think this signals a large sell-off after initial surge? Price target (old?I) is around $10.  I'm new to this! I love this sector but don't want to get in too early.

 After my post about Goldman Sachs S&amp;P500 forecast for the next 10 years (https://www.reddit.com/r/eupersonalfinance/s/8uorwocLOz) got pretty good discussion with a lot of different views and opinions, I decided to collect all  S&amp;P500 forecasts for 2025 that I can find in media published in the last 30 days. So here are predictions I have found:

POSITIVE:

UBS says SP&amp;500 could reach 6,600 by the end of 2025 which is 13% up from current level.

Goldman Sachs says S&amp;P500 will reach 6,000 by the end of 2024 and 6,300 by the end of 2025.

NEGATIVE:

Barry Bannister (chief equity strategist at Stifel) says that S&amp;P500 in 2025 will return to where 2024 began (that is at 4,609).

Title: Peloton partners with Costco to sell Bike+ as it looks to reach young, wealthy customers
Text
 Peloton’s stationary bikes will soon sell at Costco’s stores and on its website as the beleaguered fitness company looks for new ways to reach younger and affluent customers, Peloton is set to announce Tuesday.

Under the terms of the deal, Costco will offer Peloton’s Bike+ in 300 of its U.S. stores for $1,999, and on Costco.com for $2,199 between Nov. 1 and Feb. 15. It is a steep discount from the typical price of the Bike+, which is selling on Peloton’s website for $2,495. It is unclear how the price will compare to any holiday promotions Peloton plans to offer. 

The new partnership comes during a state of transition for Peloton, which is being led by two board members after its former CEO Barry McCarthy stepped down earlier this year.

Long focused on growth at all costs, Peloton has turned its sights to profitability and has had to become more creative as it tries to reach new users.

As sales fall and losses mount, Peloton is looking for cheaper ways to attract new customers. Costco is one way to get there, Dion Camp Sanders, Peloton’s chief emerging business officer, told CNBC in an interview. 

“We’ve been able to architect a deal with Costco that meets our needs with regard to profitable, sustainable unit economics, while at the same time delivering robust and clear value to Costco members,” said Camp Sanders. “We’ve structured this deal with Costco to both meet our needs for profitable, sustainable growth and getting us access to Costco’s very large net incremental audience.” 

Camp Sanders said Peloton’s partnership with Costco is only for a limited time because fitness is a seasonal category for the company, but Peloton hopes to keep building on the relationship and perhaps expand it to future locations both in the U.S. and abroad.

The deal with Costco gets Peloton onto the shelves of a retailer with a strong fan following and wealthier customers. The membership-based club has gained popularity as shoppers across all incomes prioritize value and try to get more for their money with bulk packs and private-label items.

As of Sept. 1, store traffic at Costco had increased 31% compared with the same period in pre-pandemic 2019, according to Placer.ai, an analytics company that estimates visits to locations based on smartphone data. 

Costco’s members are also getting younger. Those consumers prioritize health and wellness — and are willing to invest in it — in ways that older generations do not. 

About half of Costco’s new membership sign-ups last fiscal year came from people who were under 40 years old, and the average age of its 76 million members has fallen since the Covid-19 pandemic, Chief Financial Officer Gary Millerchip said on an earnings call in late September. 

According to Numerator, 36% of Costco’s customers have a household income of more than $125,000. Numerator has a panel of 150,000 U.S. consumers that is balanced to be representative of the country’s population.

Camp Sanders said Costco’s members “have the disposable income to be able to afford our premium products,” and their lifestyles align with what Peloton offers. 

“Many of Peloton’s members are affluent, they often have larger homes in the suburbs and they also have life situations where Peloton fits a clear need,” said Camp Sanders. “Many Costco members are juggling families, they maybe have a busy career … and they’ve got the space in their home” to build their own gyms, he continued. 

Costco’s Executive Vice President of Merchandising Claudine Adamo declined to comment to CNBC.

Peloton already sells its workout equipment through Amazon and Dick’s Sporting Goods, but has also been working to develop relationships with other companies that cater to similar customer bases. 

For example, hundreds of Hyatt Hotel properties have Peloton equipment on site. As of this month, hotel members can earn points for completing workouts on the Peloton Bike and Row during their stay. 

It also announced a deal with Truemed — the PayPal of the health savings account and flexible spending account world — that allows Peloton members to use pretax earnings to buy certain hardware products, including the Bike, Bike+ and Tread.

Title: Walmart will start delivering prescriptions as CVS and Walgreens struggle
Text
 As CVS and Walgreens shutter hundreds of stores nationwide to shore up profits and investor sentiment, Walmart said Tuesday that it is offering a new option for customers: Delivering prescriptions to their doorsteps.

The nation’s largest retailer said deliveries are now available in six states: Arkansas, Missouri, New York, Nevada, South Carolina and Wisconsin. The company said in a news release that it expects to deliver prescriptions in 49 states by the end of January. Prescription deliveries will not be available in North Dakota due to state laws, Walmart said.

The prescription delivery service is another example of how Walmart is trying to outmatch competitors on convenience along with low prices. With the new service, customers can get a mix of items dropped off during the same delivery, such as a box of tissues, blanket or chicken noodle soup.

Walmart’s new delivery offering could be another blow to drugstore chains, which are falling out of favor with consumers in a trend that has hit their profits and stock prices and forced them to reconsider their strategies. Still, it is unclear how much market share Walmart could win from CVS and Walgreens, both of which offer same-day, one-day and two-day prescription deliveries.

Tom Ward, chief e-commerce officer for Walmart U.S., said the company added pharmacy deliveries because of shopper demand.

“This is actually the number one service requested by our customers,” he said.

He said Walmart tested the deliveries in several states and saw that customers took advantage of getting a mix of items, including the prescription, in a single delivery.

Walmart’s delivery service will be available for new prescriptions and refills, the company said. It will cost $9.95 for a delivery, the standard price for Walmart doorstep deliveries, but will be free for members of Walmart+, the company’s membership program.

Health insurance plans will be applied to the transaction, like they would in the store, the company said.

The deliveries will come with a few more safety steps than Walmart’s other deliveries, the company said: Medications will be put into tamper-evident packaging. Customers can track orders in real time through Walmart’s app or website and get a photo in the app or by email when the prescription is delivered. And when a customer orders a new prescription and chooses delivery, they are prompted to do a consultation with the pharmacy by phone.

Most of Walmart’s annual revenue in the U.S. – nearly 60% – comes from groceries, but health and wellness is a growing category for the company, according to the retailer’s most recent annual filing for the fiscal year that ended Jan. 31. Health and wellness accounts for about 12% of its annual revenue in the U.S. It includes pharmacy, over-the-counter drugs and other medical products, optical services and other clinical services.

A new challenge for drugstores

As of Monday’s close, shares of Walmart were up around 54% for the year. Meanwhile, shares of CVS were down roughly 26% so far this year, while shares of Walgreens were down nearly 60%.

CVS is the top U.S. pharmacy in terms of prescription drug revenue, holding more than 25% of the market share in 2023, according to Statista data released in March. Walgreens trailed behind with nearly 15% of that share last year, while Walmart held just 5% of that share.

CVS and Walgreens are grappling with falling reimbursement rates for prescription drugs. Inflation, softer consumer spending and competition from Amazon, big-box retailers and grocery stores are making it difficult for them to turn a profit at the front of the store, which carries cleaning supplies, beauty products and pantry staples, among other items.

CVS CEO Karen Lynch left the company and was replaced by David Joyner last week, as CVS faces pressure from Wall Street and, more recently, an activist investor to turn around its business. On top of the leadership shakeup, CVS plans to cut $2 billion in expenses over several years. That includes slashing less than 1% of its workforce, or roughly 2,900 jobs, on the corporate side of its business.

The company is also wrapping up a three-year plan to close 900 of its stores, with 851 locations closed as of August.

Walgreens is similarly cutting costs, announcing last week that it will close roughly 1,200 stores over the next three years, which includes 500 in fiscal 2025 alone. The chain has around 8,700 locations in the U.S., a quarter of which it says are unprofitable.

Walmart has faced its own financial challenges on the health-care side of the business. The discounter planned to bring its low-price spin to health care by opening clinics that offered doctor, dentist and therapy appointments for less.

Yet in the spring, Walmart shuttered all of the clinics, saying in a news release at the time that it couldn’t operate a profitable business because of “the challenging reimbursement environment and escalating operating costs.”

Title: Other than revenue concerns, what kind of roadblock could RDDT face?
Text
 This is not a question about revenue or ads etc.
Overall bullish about RDDT.

 But still one needs to study the landscape and future potential roadblocks.

News Corp sued Perplexity the other day for basically copying parts of its articles (plagiarism) they claim.  

RDDT is not like Perplexity. But can provide data for it (or similar).

Could RDDT potentially get sued for selling data and some company like News Corp claim its theirs?

Or what about paywalled articles that are posted for free on some sub reddits.  Could RDDT be sued or fined for not tackling/preventing this issue?

Are the current users aware or checked off a disclaimer that their data may be sold to a 3rd party?

Any other potential roadblocks to be aware of?

Title: Thoughts on Walmart?
Text
 I'm considering picking up some shares but thought I'd see what the sub thinks.

Walmart's up 56% YTD which seems pretty astonishing for any retailer, let alone the largest company by revenue in the world.

Speaking of that revenue, it's grown from $524B in 2020 to $648B currently. P/E is 42 and EPS growth forecast according to Schwab for the 3-5 year horizon is 10.17%, which is higher than Costco and Target. 

Now they're moving into pharmaceutical delivery in an attempt to box out Walgreen's and CVS. It's a troublesome area, and WMT didn't fair well opening affordable health clinics, but does signal intent to continue growing revenue at a fast clip. 

Anecdotally, WMT seems like a great business. Their online and in-store shopping process has always been great IMO. I fondly remember my days in college going to the all night supercenter to find badly needed ping pong balls on a Saturday evening.

Any important facts or considerations I'm missing? Would love to see everyone else's POV.

This in the context of 10YR yields that went from **3.7%** to **4.2%** after the FED made the 50bps. The FEDs mandate, as you all know, is to balance employment and inflation.

**Employment:**

Some of the climb in yields comes from the idea that the economy is strong, with the unemployment rate climbing to 4.3% in July and then dropping since. A Bloomberg columnist wrote an interesting piece that talked about the idea that unemployment rate hasn’t peaked yet, due to 3 factors that played a key role in the September report.

1. Hiring in the education sector after an earlier delay
2. Outsized election spending
3. Responses to natural disasters

According to her, the drop from 4.22% to 4.05% in the unemployment rate was almost entirely driven by a 785k increase in government jobs (3.6 standard deviation move), which was the second largest monthly jump in government hiring since January 1990. Meanwhile, other Jobs fell 355k and as a result, total employment rose 430k net according to household data. Some possible explanations for the unusual increase in government hiring could be:

* The fast hiring in education, probably due to a later hiring schedule.
* A surge in hiring related to the presidential election — campaign-related activity saw an unusual increase in federal-level protective services in several swing states and Illinois — added 200,000 jobs, by their estimate.
* Emergency personnel related to reconstruction after damage by Hurricane Beryl and wildfires likely contributed about 100,000 jobs.

By their calculus, without the election cycle boost and the impact from natural disasters, the unemployment rate would have been 4.23%. Their conclusion is that those effects should persist in a lesser way in October but start reversing in December and expect a 4.5% by EOY.

**Inflation:**

Now let’s turn to the actual inflation data, the breakdown of the components of inflation ***~~(THERE SHOULD BE AN IMAGE HERE BUT THIS SUB DOESNT ALLOW GRAPHS AND STUFF).~~***

Services is the one big component that keeps pushing inflation higher, with Core Goods and energy contributing negatively to inflation (meaning they are showing lower prices now). What’s in the Services category? Well I have this table cause I got too lazy to make another graph: ***~~(THERE SHOULD BE A TABLE HERE TOO)~~***

Most of the inflation comes from Shelter, Medical Care Services and transportation services. Let’s talk about Shelter specifically. Everybody here knows that the housing market is nuts right now, there is not enough new supply to cover the demand, and the existing supply is locked due to the high mortgages. The idea here is basically that HIGHER INTEREST RATES WON’T alleviate this component, lower rates might help actually due to unlocking existing houses in the market.

Finally, last week we got retail sales that spooked some participants, but we already know that goods have been in negative territory for the last months so there shouldn’t be much problem there.

**Trade:**

Ive been shorting the TLT puts for a while, closed most of them when we got the 50 bps cut and then as we came down ive been adding. I did some of them too soon I think. Anyhow this are my positions:

* Long TLT shares
* Short Dec 20 puts, Strikes: $100, 95, 93, 90
* Short Nov 08 calls, $96.5 just to cover some of the long exposure

I think worst case I’d end up getting assigned a bunch of TLT into 2025 and going into the new year basically all in on TLT. I am getting worried tho because recently ive heard a lot of commentary about FED making a mistake with people like Stanley Druckenmiller shorting bonds with convincing arguments.

EDIT: I forgot something else, there is also the spread between the bond yields and earnings yields of the S&amp;P which is right now at historical extremes, basically saying its more attractive than stocks.

Title: Halliburton DD, Undervalued or value trap?
Text
 Hey there,  
I've been thinking of ways to profit off of potential war spiking oil up and Trump winning the election bext month. Obvious plays would be Oil or DJT respectively, but both are iffy at best. That's where I'd remembered that I've invested a few times into Halliburton $HAL, mostly swinging it for 20% and it's that time of the year again.

So what's their business? - Halliburton is one of the largest oil field service companies in the world. It provides a wide range of services and products to the energy industry, with a primary focus on oil and natural gas exploration, development, and production. Halliburton operates in over 70 countries and serves both national and independent oil and gas companies. I'll use ChatGPT to summarise the business underlying.

So what's my conviction? - You've got two ways to profit off of this business plus a large safety net in the form of a relative undervaluation. Technically speaking, the company is trading near the multi-years bottoms and the business has improved since.   
1st case: Drill baby, drill! - In case of Trump delivering on his promises to increase the rate of drilling, Halliburton profits, as it's literally their business

2nd case: Israel - Iran war breaking out - Oil is bound to increase in price as the risks increase and or the fields in the middle east get destroyed. In any case, since the company is in the Oil sector, it's bound to increase in price  
3rd case: None of these above happen - You've got a profitable, dividend paying company trading under the intrinsic value, that is projected to increase in price as per analysts' view - Lowest 52w target is still SIGNIFICANTLY above the current price

# Business breakdown (done using ChatGPT, please don't stone me)

1. **Completion and Production**
   * Services and products related to the completion of oil and gas wells, such as well cementing, stimulation (including hydraulic fracturing), and production enhancement.
   * Includes tools and systems that help improve oil and gas well output.
2. **Drilling and Evaluation**:
   * Provides services like directional drilling, well logging, and reservoir evaluation.
   * Offers technologies and services that help customers locate oil and gas reserves and understand reservoir characteristics.

# Major Services and Products:

* **Drilling Services**: Including equipment, tools, and techniques to drill and stabilize oil wells.
* **Hydraulic Fracturing**: A key service for extracting oil and natural gas from unconventional resources like shale.
* **Cementing**: Securing well integrity and preventing leaks between rock formations and drilled areas.
* **Artificial Lift**: Techniques and tools that help lift oil from the well to the surface when the reservoir pressure isn't sufficient.

I'm currently invested in at about 7.5% of my portfolio @ $28.3, ready to double down if it drops, as I trully believe this could be a good hedge againts war and possibly even major recession - Oil tends to get expensive

Please feel free to poke holes into my DD, I'd like to stir up a productive conversation below!

Title: Goldman Sachs predicts only 3% annualized returns of S&amp;P500 over the next decade
Text
 According to Goldman Sachs forecast, S&amp;P500 will give only 3% annualized return over next 10 years which is bellow average of S&amp;P500 returns in last 100 years (11% per year on average).

Do you believe in forecasts from financial institutions or in any forecasts at all?

In your opinion, how often are financial institutions wrong with their predictions?

Will you change your investing strategy if other financial institutions give similar forecasts of S&amp;P500 returns?

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help **measure the trajectory of a security.**  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **"priced in"**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

Title: Alphabet To $7 Trillion By 2025?
Text
 We believe Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) is positioned to grow its valuation by well over 3x from the already huge $2-trillion figure now – potentially becoming the world’s most valuable company by a huge margin – as its often-overlooked Waymo autonomous driving business quietly revolutionizes the transportation sector. This would take the stock to over $500 a share. Here’s why.

Fact: Waymo has grown the number of weekly paid rides from 10,000 to over 100,000 in the last 12 months. It went from 50,000 weekly rides to 100,000 just in the last six months.

The growth is compelling and the addressable market is massive

Case in point: Uber does more than 200 million rides each week. Let’s let that sink in. So if autonomous rides can capture even half that market, that would mean 100 million rides per week. That’s about 1,000 times where Waymo is today. 200 million rides a week translates to about a billion a month and over 10 billion a year. At $30 per ride, we’re talking revenues of close to $300 billion per year.

But wait… there is more to the growth story

If Waymo is already delivering over 100,000 driverless rides, how many more people might switch from driving their cars to being driven by autonomous vehicles? The shift could be massive. For each person hailing a cab, there are at least 10 others driving their own cars. Many of these drivers might reconsider once they see millions of people relaxing in the back seat, streaming Netflix, while they’re stuck behind the wheel.

In fact, early data backs this up. According to Earnest Analytics, Waymo is already retaining riders at a higher rate compared to other ride-hailing services like Uber or Lyft. People enjoy the experience of autonomous vehicles. Safety could also be another attraction. Waymo published a report last year indicating that its autonomous vehicles achieved an 85% reduction in injury-causing crashes compared to national rates for human-operated cars.

Investors will soon recognize that the $300 billion revenue figure for the current ride-hailing market has substantial growth potential – it could easily expand by 2-3x. A $1 trillion market for autonomous rides isn’t out of the question. This growth would also translate to significant revenue opportunities for automakers like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), which are working on their driverless vehicle technologies.

But wait aren’t so many automakers and tech players working on autonomous driving?

Yes, but not all of them are making the same progress. Waymo has a head start in the market. Its main competitor, General Motor’s backed Cruise lost its driverless permits in California after a serious accident, making Waymo the only publicly available robotaxi service in San Francisco. Uber exited its self-driving taxi program about six years ago and has partnered with Waymo to bring its services to the Uber app in some cities. While electric vehicle behemoth Tesla is seen as a leader of sorts in the self-driving space, given its large base of vehicles, it is only slowly getting into the space after the unveiling of its Robotaxi vehicle earlier this month.

Waymo has some advantages in terms of tech as well. It uses a fleet equipped with high-resolution cameras, LiDAR, and radar systems, creating a comprehensive view of its surroundings. And don’t forget Google’s got a secret weapon. It crowdsources annotated data such as CAPTCHA codes from its massive user base, using that to train its machine-learning models. That’s a big advantage in terms of understanding complex driving environments.

The best part?

These are self-driving cars – no human drivers, no unions, no employee or contractor issues, and no human cost. While there will be other expenses, such as software development and battery costs, the absence of driver wages could lead to exceptionally high margins. Margins of 50% aren’t unrealistic when you consider that driver earnings account for a substantial portion of gross fares in traditional ride-hailing models.

If Waymo can capture about one-third of the $1 trillion autonomous rides market, it could generate annual revenues of around $300 billion. With a 50% margin, that’s a neat $150 billion in profits. What’s that worth? At a 30x earnings multiple, that would imply an additional valuation of about $4.5 trillion for Alphabet. Considering that Alphabet is worth roughly $2 trillion presently, this could take the company’s market cap to over $6.5 trillion, or over $500 per share.

To be sure, building this sort of scale can take a good deal of time – quite different from signing up for say a Google or Netflix account. However, investors will need to look well out into the future. Think 2030 (not 2025), maybe even more. The point is not to get stuck – if you’re concerned, look even further out, say 2035! The bottom line: Alphabet is growing Waymo quickly, has the technology and competitive edge, and is addressing a potentially massive market, making this high valuation within reach.

Title: 10-year Treasury yield jumps as investors monitor Fed speeches
Text
 It would be interesting to see that 10-year Treasury yield keeps going up when Fed starts to cut interest rates in September 2024 ... something went wrong very probably \~

&amp;#x200B;

**10-year Treasury yield jumps as investors monitor Fed speeches**

[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/21/us-bonds-10-year-treasury-yield-in-focus-amid-flurry-of-fed-speeches.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/21/us-bonds-10-year-treasury-yield-in-focus-amid-flurry-of-fed-speeches.html)

&amp;#x200B;

*The U.S. 10-year Treasury yield jumped on Monday as investors digest a flurry of speeches from Federal Reserve policymakers.*
  

  
*The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose more than 9 basis points to 4.172 %. The yield on the 2-year Treasury was up about 7 basis points to 4.025%.*
  

  
*Yields and prices move in opposite directions. One basis point equals 0.01%.*
  

  
*On a day without any major economic data releases, market participants are likely to scrutinize comments from officials at the U.S. central bank.*
  

  
*Dallas Federal Reserve President Lorie Logan said Monday she supports the current move to lowering interest rates, but that a patient approach will be needed.*
  

  
*“If the economy evolves as I currently expect, a strategy of gradually lowering the policy rate toward a more normal or neutral level can help manage the risks and achieve our goals,” Logan said during a speech in New York. “However, any number of shocks could influence what that path to normal will look like, how fast policy should move and where rates should settle. In my view, the \[Federal Open Market Committee\] will need to remain nimble and willing to adjust if appropriate.”*
  

  
*Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari, Kansas City Fed President Jeff Schmid and San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly are also delivering remarks on Monday.*
  

  
*The Federal Open Market Committee took the unusual step last month of lowering its baseline interest rate by a half percentage point, or 50 basis points, to a target range of 4.75% to 5%.*

Title: What does it mean when the stock price rises, while the short interest rises alongside it?
Text
 In the case of the stock CompoSecure (CMPO) ([info](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/cmpo)), I have the following data:


Date, Stock price, short interest, % of float:
- 06/28, $6.8,              4MM, 15.5%
- 07/15, $7.67,              4.5MM, 17.5%
- 07/31, $8.15,             5.4MM, 21%
- 08/15, $11.02,           8.2MM, 31.9%
- 08/30, $11.73,          10.1MM, 39.2%
- 09/13, $12.39,          10.8MM, 42%
- 09/30, $14.02,          13MM, 50.5%

As you can see not only has the stock price increased dramatically but so has the short interest ([Nasdaq data](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/cmpo/short-interest)). Any possible explanation for this? What I’ve seen in the past is that if a stock has a high short interest, and the price gradually rises, typically, you’d see the short interest trend downward. However, it seems like the opposite is true for CMPO.

Any wrinkle brains willing to give an explanation?

Title: Disney will name new CEO in early 2026; Gorman to become board chair next year
Text
 Disney has tapped James Gorman to replace Mark Parker as the company’s next chairman, effective in January, as the media giant lays the groundwork to name a successor for CEO Bob Iger in early 2026, the company said Monday.

Gorman joined Disney’s board less than a year ago and was named the head of the succession planning committee in August. He will continue to lead that committee after he takes over as board chairman from Nike Executive Chairman Parker.

“The Disney board has benefited tremendously from James Gorman’s expertise and guidance, and we are lucky to have him as our next chairman – particularly as the board continues to move forward with the succession process,” Iger said in a statement. “I’m extremely grateful to Mark Parker for his many years of board service and leadership, which have been so valuable to this company and its shareholders, and to me as CEO.”

Parker will step down after nine years on the Disney board “to focus on other areas” of his work, according to a Disney statement. That includes spending more time working on Nike-related matters, according to a person familiar with the matter. Elliott Hill took over as Nike CEO last week, replacing John Donahoe.

Early 2026

Disney had initially targeted 2025 to announce a successor, as CNBC reported last year. Pushing the date back to early 2026 will give the board more time to conduct due diligence on both internal and external candidates, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because the discussions are private.

Gorman has experience with succession planning: He oversaw the orderly transfer of power at Morgan Stanley, with Ted Pick succeeding him as CEO there at the start of this year.

Succession hasn’t been smooth at Disney. The board fired Iger’s handpicked successor, Bob Chapek, in November 2022 after a turbulent tenure that lasted less than three years. Iger returned to the CEO job, and now, Disney shareholders are eager to see a succession plan stick.

Iger’s four direct reports — ESPN Chairman Jimmy Pitaro, Disney Experiences Chairman Josh D’Amaro, and Disney Entertainment Co-Chairmen Dana Walden and Alan Bergman — have all interviewed with the succession committee in recent weeks, since Gorman took over in August, according to the people familiar.

Gorman said in a CNBC interview in March, before taking over as the board’s succession chair, that Disney was running a “forward-looking, forward-leaning, incredibly disciplined process.”

Still, while putting a specific timeline on naming a successor adds a bit of clarity to the search, it also means the question of who will take over for Iger will continue to hover over the company for another year.

Iger has pushed back his retirement five different times to continue to lead Disney as CEO. Activist investor Nelson Peltz focused on the board’s failure to name a lasting successor in his unsuccessful campaign to gain board seats earlier this year.

Iger’s current contract as CEO runs until Dec. 31, 2026. He and the board haven’t decided if Iger will extend his board tenure past 2026, said the people familiar.

Title: Would I be paying more taxes and losing more money withdrawing profits from stocks vs just keeping Salary? 
Text
 I want to invest a lot of my salary into stocks to make more money. But if I withdraw profits  from stock, I have to pay more taxes. Would the taxes on my salary and my stock profits actually just make me lose more money or equate to even amount, if I hadn’t just invested at all? 
For example, let’s say I make $2000 a month salary. Then let’s say I profit $2000 from a stock a month. Would this actually make me lose more money paying double taxes? Or would this just make me even, meaning no difference if I had just kept my salary and never invested.

 Are there any good etfs dedicated to AI or is it a better idea to invest in technology focused ETFs such as VGT or QQQ?

I purchased a few shares of SMH but it is more focused on the hardware aspect of AI. Also, it went down after I have purchased and I have been in the negative for quite some time. So I am not very hopeful about it and hence looking at AI ETF's specifically focused on the software side like OPEN AI, perplexity etc.

Golden Entertainment (NASDAQ: GDEN) offers a compelling opportunity for value investors, thanks to its attractive valuation, strategic growth, and improving foot traffic trends. Here’s why GDEN deserves a closer look.

**Key Fundamentals and Considerations**

1. **Valuation:**
   * **P/E Ratio:** 3.35 (vs. sector peers like Sands at 24, MGM at 15 and Wynn at 13). This suggests GDEN is deeply undervalued compared to the market​
2. **Improving Hotel Performance:**
   * **STRAT Hotel and Casino** achieved **record revenue** in Q2 2024.
   * **ADR increased by 8%**, with **occupancy rising 4%** YoY to 73%.
   * Weekend occupancy hit an impressive **97%**, while midweek occupancy improved to **64%**, demonstrating growing visitor traffic
3. **Earnings Call on November 7, 2024:**
   * With a projected **516% EPS increase** over the next year, the upcoming earnings call could trigger significant upside. (Marketbeat)

**Risks to Monitor**

* **Insider Sales:** Recent sales by insiders reflect cautious profit-taking but not necessarily a lack of confidence, as insiders still retain significant holdings​
* **Sector Volatility:** While improving, hospitality and gaming sectors remain sensitive to macroeconomic conditions.

**Conclusion:** potential high value play with growth potential

Golden Entertainment’s rising foot traffic, particularly at the STRAT, coupled with its undervaluation, makes it an intriguing investment. With growing momentum in its core Nevada operations and expansion in tavern locations, GDEN offers a promising blend of growth and value.

Title: What the hell is happening with Qualcomm's stock?
Text
 Good sales, good numbers, and their laptop chips have been received very positively. People started talking about its products and recommending them, but this is not reflected in its stock price. The company has not recovered from the market pullback and is still -20% compared to its price from 2 months ago, while all other companies have not only recovered but also made  +10%. Even Google, which is facing a huge anti-trust lawsuit that might dismantle the company, is doing better. So, what the hell?

Title: Buying stocks in a malarkey market
Text
 This may be a no shit Sherlock observation but sitting on cash and waiting (waiting, waiting, and waiting) for a particular stock to crash because of scandal or sour sentiment seems to be the way. I used to pick stocks based on long term value, fundamentals, and sometimes FOMO hype but my returns were middling. The past year or so I've waited for bad news to wreck a stock because it doesn't seem like there's any long term punishment for these companies. I watched CRWD take a dive after a scandal, bought at $217. I watched SMCI drop on a scandal, bought at $39. SAVA faceplanted on a scandal, bought at $12. ASTS at $3, PI at $49, BABA at $81, etc... Now I'm making money all of a suddenly. Is this a good strategy or have I just gotten lucky lately? Because I still hesitate now and then. SNOW, for instance, dropped to $110 and INTC to under $20 and I have NOT pulled the trigger for whatever reason.

Title: ALT  Obesity, hype is not over.   Upside enormous 
Text
 Obesity stock. Altimmune  management has continuously stated: **We want a partner at the Phase 3 Trial design meeting with the FDA**

Meeting, as per PR, early November. Therefore, a partner anticipated to be announce any day now. Though, to be honest - we have been waiting for a year now. Altimmune, unlike others, is in advanced stages and has FAST TRACK STATUS.

If this comes true, retail can sit in a warm bath together with Sexy Institutions and Shorts.

* Float 71 million
* Institutional ownership 63%, 43 million
* Short 31%, 22 million
   * **Do the math: Retail left-overs?**
      * No dilution expected, 150 million in the bank.

What does a Obesity play getting a trial fully funded looks like?

[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VKTX/](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VKTX/)

If partner announced, see beginning of chart (10$-30$). If additional data announced, see trajectory from Feb onward (30$ - 90$)

* *Lean Loss Ratio of only 21.9%, representing class-leading preservation of lean mass*
* *Maintenance of lean mass preservation in individuals over the age of 60, a population at risk for frailty-related falls and fractures*
* *Visceral adipose tissue (VAT), a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, reduced by 28.3% at Week 48*

===============================

A bit of DD mixed with opinion:

1. **Why $ALT over $VKTX?**
   * VKTX-2735 &lt; PEMVI 2.4mg -- PEMVI superior quality of Weight Loss as measured by % FAT vs. % LEAN reduction (i.e. the KEY next-gen GLP1 metric)
   * PEMVI broad CARDIOVASCULAR activity/potential
   * PEMVI MOA includes Thermogenic/RMR component for LT use
   * PEMVI body recomp. potential via class-leading lean muscle preservation
   * PEMVI P3 titration/DR design to 'fix' outlier 48wk P2 (other PEMVI studies have shown tolerability on par with VK2735)
   * VK2735 is faster WL which is better for BMI 40+ class 3 Obesity (smaller market), but not for avg. person -- VK to compete with $LLY Zep,
   * PEMVI is SIGNIFICANTLY differentiated high quality Next-gen GLP1 WL
   * VKTX-2809 &lt; PEMVI 1.8mg -- PEMVI rapid liver defatting in 6-12 wks (MASLD)
   * PEMVI better 24wk anti-fibrotic potential vs 52wk VKTX
   * PEMVI bypasses thyroid and is leading GLP1 liver MOA
2. **Why is Viking valued at 50$ and Altimmune at 6$?**
   * Viking Management simply is better at managing their stock. Viking has 900 million in cash, which they simply raised in a brilliant way.
   * Altimmune had a short report to endure, in which Kerrisdale stupidly rehashed old data, BUT Altimmune management FAILED at protecting the stock they let Jefferies do their bidding.
   * Altimmune cash runway 150 million (or so), they stupidly ran the ATM at the absolute wrong moment.
3. **But why is Altimmune still the better stock?**
   * Pemvi as explained above, is smarter. Not Obesity, but curative fatty liver - COVERED BY INSURANCE ALREADY. Which pure obesity drugs are not, like Zepbound Wegovy
   * Altimmune has FAST TRACK status. A nugget overseen by many
   * Altimmune has a much much larger upside, at this moment. The odds of Viking crashing, extremely high. They are a Bio, they will face a setback. I believe if Viking was to be bought now, it would be at 100$ per share
   * If Altimmune was to be bought now, 40$-75$ per share would be fair.
   * If Altimmune announces a partner, it will likely be a 20$ 30$ stock within days.

 I’m surprised more people aren’t talking about it. I mean, it’s literally google, not going anywhere.

 September 23rd was at -.89% today October 21st it’s at -.47%. 
  
Another 30 days approx if that, it will definitely go positive. 
  
Then we will find out if it this time is different. 
  
I find it funny that the Fed started cutting rates on September 18th 2024, they also started cutting rates on September 18th 2007….. by .50 basis points both times. 
  
If this isn’t cynical foreshadowing then I don’t know what is.

Title: Ripe for picking - (FDMT) 4D Molecular Therapeutics?
Text
 Their current pipeline focus "4D-150" is for treatment of Neovascular (Wet) Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD).

FDMT current market cap $443.30M

1. **Potential Market:**
   - 20 million US citizens aged 40 and older have AMD, with 200,000 new cases added each year.
   - 10-15% are Wet AMD, so 2-3 million affected.
   - Current treatment involves Anti-VEGF shots into the eye every 4-12 weeks (lifelong treatment, no cure).
   - Latest 4D-150 Phase 2 results show "83% overall reduction in annualized injections through 52 weeks" and "70% injection-free through 52 weeks".
   - It's RNA-based, so shots will need to be repeated eventually.
   - Current anti-VEGF treatment costs $13,875 to $24,000 per person annually.
   - Conservative estimate: 4D-150 priced at $15,000 per shot (likely 2-3x higher as it's gene therapy), capturing 20% of 2 million market = 400,000 patients.
   - **Potential annual revenue: $6 billion (400,000 * $15,000)**
   - Global anti-VEGF market: $12.3 billion in 2022, estimated $13.7 billion by 2031.
   - If 4D-150 captures 20% of that: $2.46 billion annually.
   - **Potential market cap: $7.38 billion (3x revenue)** - a 1463% increase from current value (assuming successful Phase 3 and market entry). Assuming it will take 3-5 years for the drug to hit the market, we are looking at 300%-500% annual yield.

2. **Safety:** "Comparable to approved anti-VEGF agents", suggesting likely Phase 3 success and market entry.

3. **Competition:**
   - Currently, no gene therapy drugs for AMD are on the market.
   - 23 gene therapy studies for AMD are in various stages of clinical trials.
   - Among these studies, only three companies are listed on NASDAQ:
   - FDMT, ADVM, RGNX
   - All at similar stages with comparable results (FDMT results slightly better (look at the "Reduction in Annualized Anti-VEGF Injections")).

4. **Finances:**
   - FDMT has $541.95M cash, sufficient until 2030 (based on current FCF of -$87.17M)
   - Competitors have 1.5-2 years of cash, likely facing dilution
   - FDMT's market cap should be way higher when compared to those direct competitors (imo).

5. **Stock Performance Paradox:**

Despite consistently positive results, FDMT's stock has experienced a significant decline. Here's a breakdown of the situation:

- Since February 5th presentation which lead to a huge upward spike, FDMT has released two additional analyses of their 4D-150 drug:
  - July 17 presentation
  - September 18 presentation
  - Both show even better numbers than the February results

**Potential Explanation for low stock price: Heavy Shorting**

- [This graph](https://i.imgur.com/xE0EjSx.jpeg) combines data from NASDAQ and StockAnalysis.com
- Between July 13-17 (after 2nd presentation release):
  - Short interest dropped from 10.3M to 9.5M
  - Spike in average daily share volume
- Interpretation: Short sellers likely closed positions after seeing good results, driving the price down

**Unexpected Consequence:**

- This triggered an investigation:
  &gt; "The investigation focuses on whether the Company issued false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose information pertinent to investors. 4D Molecular Therapeutics released the interim results of its Phase 2 PRISM study on Intravitreal 4D-150 on July 17, 2024. Despite the Company billing the results as positive, the stock fell by more than 35.8% in afternoon trading on the same day."

- In my opinion, the current situation isn't related to securities fraud, but rather reflects the inherent volatility of the biotech market. However, the mere mention of 'securities fraud' has negatively impacted the company's stock profile, leading to further declines. This has been exacerbated by repeated dissemination of this news on Accesswire since July.
Consequently, short interest has increased significantly, currently **41.39%** of the float is shorted with a 7-day cover period. This level of short interest seems **CRAZY** for a promising pre-revenue biotech stock and suggests the potential for a short squ-eeze.
While the timing is uncertain, the combination of high short interest and extended cover period indicates a likelihood of future price increases.

**TLDR**: FDMT shows strong potential in AMD treatment with better financials than competitors. Current stock price seems undervalued, possibly due to shorting. High short interest suggests potential for a squee-ze raising the current price substantially.

What are your thoughts? Am I missing any crucial points?

EDIT: I haven't started a position yet, this post is like a sanity check.

Title: Are there any stocks you will never buy because they don't align with your values?  What are they?  If you want to share, why not?
Text
 For moral, ethical, religions etc reasons, is there a company's stock you will never buy, no matter how good the financial return.  For example, some people  say " I would never buy Dos Amigos Enterprises (fictional name) shares because they use Mexican slave labor to make their Tequila".

Title: How dumb would it be to invest a large sum of money (90k) into, individual, "safe" stocks instead of in VOO?
Text
 essentially the title. I have about 90k sitting in my vanguard brokerage already invested in VOO. My work 401k &amp; personal Roth IRA are already invested in S&amp;P 500 funds. I am 32 and want to take on some risk (hoping to retire in my late 50s). The funds I was looking at throwing the money at, would be in some combination of NVDA, MSFT, GOOG, and AMZN - in no specific order. In terms of an investment horizon, I was thinking DCA these funds over the next 10 years. While I'm aware there is no such thing as a safe stock, I feel like I could at least make some money over the next decade with these (or *hopefully* beat the S&amp;P average return - if only by a little) stocks, as they are "generally" safe over time - a statement I use very loosely and realize the flaw in using historical averages to predict future ones. Would doing this be stupid, and should I continue holding the funds in VOO, or is this plan not the worst idea?

Title: I spent some time reading again on SMCI and I wonder why didn't SMCI sue Hindenburg for falsehood
Text
 That is if it is really falsehood by Hindenburg which SMCI is convinced of. Granted SMCI did have some shoddy track records in the past. What is most concerning to me is former employee and whistleblower Bob Luong filing a lawsuit against SMCI. This is one man against a large cap sized company.

I like SMCI but the lawsuit by Bob Luong just feels like an abatross around the neck.

Title: Construction of data centers?

 Looking to identify stocks of companies involved in the construction of data centers.

Title: Where do you keep your money in between buying opportunities?
Text
 Assuming a brokerage account...

You bought a stock that you liked, and saw some significant gains. Over time, the stock climbed to a level that now feels inflated. You can't see the stock maintaining this level for very long. You cash out and pocket the gains.

Now, you have cash in your brokerage account. Do you leave it in cash until you find another buying opportunity? Do you put it into an ETF, and cash out again when needed?

Title: Trying to Decide Between Public.com and Charles Schwab
Text
 I haven't explored a lot of different investing platforms, but I want a platform that I can experiment and learn with. I am not new to investing and understand a good bit more than just the basics, but I haven't made a ton of orders nor have I experimented a lot outside of simple stock investing.

I'm looking at two platforms, Public.com and Charles Schwab. I only have a little experience with Charles Scwahb and haven't looked at any other platform before. But I've seen some good things about public too. Especially considering their seemingly better user interface.

Curious what y'all think and recommend for me.

 Man google is basically like 80% of my portfolio and i’ve kept hearing negativity surrounding it (regulatory risk, search &amp; ads business at risk, managerial issues..etc). Personally i think their revenue gonna beat but net profit will decrease due to their overspending in AI related investments.

Title: Why do you guys even bother trading when you can just buy the S&amp;P 500?
Text
 I’m genuinely curious. I’m not trying to dog on any of yall. I’m sure some of you have made a lot of money on individual stocks.

But like… I struggle to understand why you guys even bother. I just don’t see a point in investing in single company stocks.

They’re too volatile, companies change, etc. for instance Cisco used to practically be a monopoly. Now I’m not even sure it’ll reach the ATH from 20 years ago… ever. 

Also all of the time invested. Time is money… you really gotta research a lot before even considering buying stocks. 

So why not just go S&amp;P 500, bonds, 401k, etc. it’s going great for me (130k net worth at 25.) 

Just curious, thanks.

 As title states, currently holding RIVN and it is down about 66% since I purchased it. It's sitting at just over $10 a share. I was holding onto it hoping that the likely booming EV market would include RIVN, but doesn't appear to be the case for a variety of reasons.

So, just curious as to what others think. 

I'm definitely a novice, but have had an etrade account since 2020 and have experienced a decent overall return. 

RIVN is currently on the chopping block.

Title: Are there any stocks you will always buy because they align with your values? What are they? If you want to share, why not?

 There was a post that asked the question in the negative, it was a great question, but I thought that the opposite question should be asked. Are there stocks that you feel are worth your investment? Stocks you won't invest in is important, but which stocks do you feel align with your values?

If you are willing to share those stocks, what is it about them that aligns with your values?

BTW, credit to the original poster of the opposite question:

Title: Nebius set to resume Nasdaq trading after completing split from Russia’s Yandex
Text
 Oct 17 (Reuters) - AI infrastructure firm Nebius Group (NBIS.O), opens new tab said on Thursday its shares will resume Nasdaq trading on Monday after being halted following Russia's February 2022 invasion of Ukraine.
At that time, the stock traded under the ticker of Russian internet giant Yandex through its Amsterdam-based parent company.
In July, a Russian consortium finalized a $5.4 billion deal to acquire the Russia-based assets of Yandex, a move that marked the largest corporate exit since the invasion.

"We are pleased to have our shares trading again on Nasdaq, which opens a new chapter for our company as a publicly traded pure play in the fast-growing AI infrastructure space," Nebius CEO Arkady Volozh said.
Other Russian companies were suspended and ultimately delisted from Nasdaq, but Nebius maintained a suspended listing during months of negotiations to secure an exit from Russia, provided it could decouple from Yandex.

Many of the same Western shareholders have stakes in Nebius, but the company has undergone a significant transformation.
Once valued at over $30 billion as Russia's equivalent of Google, Nebius is now a fledgling European tech company focused on AI infrastructure, cloud services, and self-driving technology.
AI-FOCUSED

With its Russian ties severed, Nebius is strategically positioning itself to capitalize on the burgeoning AI market, founder and CEO Arkady Volozh told Reuters in July. Nebius plans to invest more than $1 billion by mid-2025.b

"Our ambition is to build one of the world's largest specialist AI infrastructure businesses. This requires access to technological expertise, graphics processing units ("GPUs") and capital. These are exactly what we have", Volozh said.
Nebius had annualized run-rate revenue of $120 million as of September 30, 2024, and it expects to be on track for $170 million to $190 million in annualized run-rate revenue by year end 2024, the statement said.

Nebius Group N.V. (“Nebius Group” or the “Company”; NASDAQ: NBIS) today announces that it has been informed by The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) that trading in the Company's Class A ordinary shares is scheduled to resume on Monday October 21, 2024.

Title: Games Workshop - Hold or Sell?
Text
 In late August I bought €450 of Games Workshop stock.  
For those who don't know, Games Workshop (GW) is a hobby shop based in the UK but with stores across a range of countries in Europe, NA, the Commonwealth and China. The shop is most famous as the designers and producers of the Warhammer franchise.

Typically when I invest I just put money in funds because I don't think I can generally do a better job than professional traders. In this case, I came to the conclusion that the stock was undervalued for two reasons. (1) The stores had returned very healthy growth in the 2023/2024 financial year, including a healthy uptake in footfall (2) the market had underappreciated the impact of the Space Marine 2 game, set to come out in September, on future GW revenue. I'd seen some gameplay footage back in maybe July and was quite confident it was going to be a hit.

My plan was to buy the stock, hold until the half-year report in January and sell if I'm in profit.

Well it looks like I was right...   
GW have capitalized on the success of Space Marine 2 by selling a tie-in starter set.   
These have been selling like hot cakes according to folks I know who work in stores.  
Web chatter seems to agree that footfall is up.  
The markets seem to agree and the stock price has risen about 12% in a month.

All sounds good, right?   
I should stick to my original plan, hold till the January report and then sell when good sales figures buoy the stock price.

The big question mark, however, is an ongoing deal (or lack thereof) with Amazon to produce a small-screen Warhammer 40K series with Henry Cavill as the creative director. Cavill, for reference, is a long-time fan of the IP and is widely expected to do a good job, if a deal were to come through. However, the project has been under a degree of uncertainty following the general contraction of the streaming industry and GW have put a limit of the end of the year to come to a deal, or they're pulling the plug.

Obviously, if the TV show is announced, it could drive the stock price nice and high.  
But if the deal falls through, I'm concerned that this could set the stock back and offset the gains I've made.

So what do you all think?  
(1) Sell now. Bank a nice little return.  
(2) Hold till the January report and hope that there's good news on the Amazon deal, and/or a good half-year report.

 Netflix posted third-quarter earnings that beat on the top and bottom line Thursday after the bell.

The company’s advertising business continued to grow in the third-quarter, with ad-tier memberships jumping 35% quarter-over-quarter. It’s on track to launch this service in Canada in the coming quarter and more broadly in 2025.

Here are the results:

Earnings per share: $5.40 compared with the $5.12 expected by LSEG.

Revenue: $9.83 billion compared with the $9.77 billion expected by LSEG.

Paid memberships: 282.7 million compared to 282.15 million expected, according to StreetAccount

Title: Investing $140k
Text
 My wife has student loans of 200k. We just came into 140k cash from a good deal, but this is pretty much all the savings we have, outside of my 401k and an emergency stash. 

Hey student loans aren’t generating interest atm., just sitting. 

I am thinking to put it all into VTSAX, and pull it out when it gets to 200k to pay them, or when something changes and her loans will start accruing interest again. 

Obviously ideally I’d make bank on stock market and loans wouldn’t accrue interest for a long while etc etc. so there’s money left over after repayment. But I want to be very realistic and careful as loosing that chunk would obviously put us back to square one. 

What do you think of this strategy and are there options I am missing? 

Edit: 1) for context we have 3 kids and a happy marriage. Not considering her leaving after loan is payed, for better or worse. 2) I am asking for advice and not committed to doing this. Just paying off the loan is where we started but we feel that having this chunk can be an opportunity so we want to ensure we talk through all the option and consider the risk for each.

Title: Fickle on China
Text
 I'm fickle over China/KWEB. Their stock market is pretty much an on/off switch unlike the US. And they appear to be turning it on again, but it's hard to trust them. They are socialist, authoritarian, but also capitalist society. Singapore is a better and less corrupt version of it, and the economic results are good. So the economics will work out in China as they use immigration to offset population decline. And I'm cool with the VIE structure because the American listed shares don't trade at a discount to the HK listed shares. I just don't trust authority when it has this much power. 

How do I get through that bias to see if the opportunity is real this time?

Title: Google CEO names new search and ads boss, slides predecessor to chief technologist
Text
 Google is replacing Prabhakar Raghavan, the company’s search and ads boss, with longtime Google executive Nick Fox.

The move was announced by Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai, who said in a blog post on Thursday that Raghavan will be moving into the role of chief technologist after 12 years of leading teams across the search company. Raghavan will continue to report to Pichai in the new role, the company told CNBC in a statement.

“Prabhakar has decided it’s time to make a big leap in his own career,” Pichai wrote in the post. “In this role, he’ll partner closely with me and Google leads to provide technical direction and leadership and grow our culture of tech excellence.”

The move comes as Google continues to restructure its teams to move more quickly in the artificial intelligence arms race, where it faces increased competition. The company is also dealing with several antitrust lawsuits related to its search and ads business.

Fox has long been a member of Raghavan’s leadership team. He will be leading Google’s Knowledge and Information division, which includes the company’s search, ads and commerce products, Pichai said.

A Google employee since 2003, Fox has been vice president for product and design for the company’s Assistant product in recent years. He previously worked within the company’s ads business unit.

“Over the past few years, Nick has been instrumental in shaping Google’s AI product roadmap and collaborating closely with Prabhakar,” Pichai wrote.

Raghavan led the knowledge and information unit since 2018. Earlier this year, he told employees to prepare for a different market reality because “things are not like they were 15-20 years ago,” CNBC reported.

Additionally, Pichai announced that the team working on Google’s Gemini app, which includes Google’s AI direct-to-consumer products, will join Google DeepMind under AI head Demis Hassabis.

“Bringing the teams closer together will improve feedback loops, enable fast deployment of our new models in the Gemini app,” Pichai wrote.

The move also means the Assistant teams focused on devices and home experiences will move to the Platforms and Devices unit “so they can sit closer to the product surfaces they’re building for,” Pichai wrote.

Title: Intel seeks billions for minority stake in Altera business, sources say
Text
 Intel is looking to sell at least a minority stake in its Altera subsidiary that would raise several billion dollars in cash for the struggling firm, according to people familiar with the matter. This move that would represent a sharp about face from its earlier public messaging about the larger company’s prospects.

The storied semiconductor firm has made overtures to a number of private equity and strategic investors this week, said the people, who requested anonymity to speak freely about confidential information. Intel has expressed to some of those investors that it would be possible to acquire a majority stake in the Altera business, which was valued at $16.7 billion when Intel acquired it in 2015, said one of the people.

Intel is looking for a deal that values Altera at around $17 billion, said the people.

A representative for Intel did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment. The sale process represents an abrupt about-face from Intel’s prior commentary on Altera, where as recently September its CEO said that Intel’s leadership considered the business to be a core part of Intel’s future.

Intel has previously said that it could look to monetize its Altera business via an initial public offering, possibly as soon as 2026. But the idea of taking strategic or private equity investment would be a marked acceleration of those plans.

CEO Pat Gelsinger and his leadership team have previously said that Intel understands its disadvantaged position and is working aggressively to remedy it. To be sure, the sale of a minority stake in Altera would allow Intel to more easily pursue its semiconductor fabrication ambitions and assuage investors that it has a strong path forward as an independent company.

But the sale process also comes as Qualcomm has expressed interest in acquiring its onetime rival, a deal which would face fierce regulatory scrutiny and reshape semiconductor industry. Intel has to grapple with a significant debt load, and has seen its stock plunge more than 50% year-to-date.

Title: Is a gamestop scenario happening in China right now？
Text
 JD.com (HKG: 9618, NASDAQ: JD), a Chinese e-commerce platform specializing in electronics and premium products, is well-known for its responsive customer support. However, the company has recently gained attention due to a controversial endorsement event by Yang Li, a talk show host known for her misandrist rhetoric and numerous remarks against geeks. Yang's involvement has previously been linked to significant stock price declines for other companies (e.g., 600702.SH, SHA: 600398, and others) that featured her in commercials or as a spokesperson.

Amidst ongoing heated gender debates in China, many of JD's male customers have mobilized through social media to express their discontent. Early actions included calls for JD Plus membership refunds and requests for VAT invoices on past purchases. To date, there have been over 300,000 posts across various social media platforms discussing this issue.

As of yesterday, netizens have escalated their response, withdrawing funds from JD-affiliated investment products and short-term funds. They have also advocated for using JD's lending services to withdraw as much money as possible within the one-month interest-free period, effectively triggering fears of a "run" on JD’s financial services. In response, [JD.com](http://JD.com) attempted to mitigate concerns by sending text messages to its financial service users, denying the existence of a run. Ironically, this only fueled further withdrawals, as people feared the situation was real.

Additionally, some users reported that certain JD Finance fund accounts had restricted redemptions, with payment accounts shifting from JD to liquidity borrowing accounts at China Industrial Bank. As of today, reports indicate that Industrial Bank's short-term liquidity funds have been depleted, prompting a further shift of payment accounts to Ping An Bank.

There was a 12% decline in JD's stock following the announcement of Yang Li as the spokesperson for their event. While there was a brief recovery on the 18th after JD issued an apology, many netizens deemed the apology insincere and continued to call for further action over the weekend.

 This is the daily discussion, so anything stocks related is fine, but the theme for today is on fundamentals, but if fundamentals aren't your thing then just ignore the theme.

-----

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS &amp; revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

 Well, we are always on this platform and I'm just wondering, do you own or intend to own the stock?

It's still relatively  new, so just wanna hear your thoughts on RDDT. 

My initial thoughts were, oh look at PINS and SNAP. Then there's, oh look at META. Any thoughts or insights are welcome. Thank you!

Title: What’s your opinion on semiconductor ETFs?
Text
 I currently hold XEQT for the majority of my portfolio and some HXQ. I’m looking to dive deeper into the tech industry, but I want to avoid the big 7 stocks as I already have that through HXQ. I found the semiconductor ETFs to be a good technology niche with great growth potential, due to the high demand and usage of semiconductors. 

(I know that with an ETF like that, I should expect high volatility but I am okay with it knowing that I will be holding it for at least 3-5 years.)

 I bough META almost 2 year back, and the stock for me is almost 100% in profit

Should I sell a portion of the profit and repurchase meta (long-term investing), or should I keep it for the future without touching it 

I don't want to sell to use the cash, I want to keep in the stock, but I don't know if I need to sell and buy again or keep it growing or like its right now

The Stock is a strong stock and is expected to grow more, but I hear ppl say that I need to take part of the profit and then reinvest it again. other say, just leave it and don't think about it.

whats your advice about these 2 ideas?

Title: Uber has discussed a bid for travel booking company Expedia
Text
 Uber discussed a bid for travel booking company Expedia, CNBC confirmed, in a deal that would push the ride-share company into new markets beyond car travel and food delivery.

The talks were in early stages, according to a person familiar with the discussions who asked not to be named since the talks are confidential. It remains unclear if an acquisition will take place. Expedia is familiar territory for Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, who previously served as CEO of the travel group from 2005 to 2017. Khosrowshahi is still a non-executive member of Expedia’s board.

Uber has a market cap of around $168 billion, greater than its pandemic peak of around $112 billion, when customers were trapped indoors and relied on food deliveries. Shares fell in 2022 as the company struggled with high gas prices, inflation and bringing more drivers back to the platform. Its target, Expedia, is worth around $20 billion.

Uber’s interest in Expedia was first reported by the Financial Times.

Shares of Expedia were up more than 6% Thursday morning.

Expedia users can book flights, lodging, cars and activities through the company’s website, and it owns additional travel sites like Hotels.com, Vrbo and Orbitz. Expedia reported $28.8 billion total gross bookings in its second-quarter results in August.

An acquisition of Expedia would be a ”’major strategic home run” for Uber, Dan Ives, Wedbush Securities managing partner, told CNBC’s “Squawk Box” on Thursday. He said this suggests Uber is going on offense and looking for new monitization opportunities, and it could be a step toward a “super app.”

“They have a massive mojo, and they’re just gaining more and more share,” Ives said. “I think they’re going to be on the hunt for M&amp;A.”

Title: European Stocks
Text
 Good evening everyone!

Do any of you guys have European stocks as a significant part of your portfolio? I am worried that mainly owning American stocks and ETFs puts me at a massive risk in case of a downturn. Especially considering the P/E ratios of American stocks are much higher than those of their European counterparts at the moment.

Would you consider buying some European (mainly Dutch, Danish and so) stocks in order to reduce your exposure to a potential heavy drop in American stocks? Or do you think in such scenario European stocks would drop just as much? In that case, the (expected) lower gains of European markets up to that point would mean owning them was not worth it.

Thank you very much in advance!

 First off, congrats to anyone else who bought UAL during the pandemic.

Ever since their announcement a few days ago, I've been hearing a lot of talk about their stock buyback. Some good, some bad.

I have a very basic understanding of stock buybacks (as in I watched 2 YouTube videos on it this morning), so I don't quite understand what this means for UAL. Can someone explain?

Bonus question: How should this affect when I sell UAL?

 Some of the news I've seen so far has been negative: the company missing production target, horrors of cybertruck, increasing competition outside states due to cheaper Chinese cars, the recent disappointing cybercab event, and now FSD being investigated for killing pedestrians. The only bullish thing I saw were the increasing sales in China. What are your thoughts for the upcoming earnings and why?

Title: ASML’s issues should have been a positive for TSMC and Intel
Text
 If the China export restrictions are the primary cause for ASML’s weakness, then that must mean that TSMC and Intel will have an easier time acquiring ASML machines. 

One of the biggest costs for chip fabs is the machines. It’s the reason TSMC has not invested heavily into high NA EUV machines because they are simply too expensive to make sense economically right now. 

With nearly half of ASML’s market wiped out over night, TSMC and Intel should have a much easier time securing these machines faster and at a lower price due to less competition. 

Therefore, the analysts were wrong. They should have saw this and bought up TSMC and Intel instead of selling all semiconductor stocks after ASML’s report.

Title: I Flipped My Entire Portfolio of ETFs for AI Stocks
Text
 Yesterday, I made a major shift in my stock portfolio. I used to rely on ETFs like SPY, QQQ, and SCHD, but now I’ve sold most of them and focused on NVDA, MSFT, GOOGL, ISRG, AAPL, SCHG, and a bit of SOXX.

 - NVDA $237K

 - SCHG $121K

 - MSFT $105K

 - GOOGL $78K

 - AAPL $74K

 - ISRG $64K

 - SOXX $61K

 - BRK-B $47K

Here’s why: Right now, AI might feel limited to things like ChatGPT, but its potential goes far beyond that. Over the next 3, 5, or 10 years, AI is going to transform industries in ways we can’t fully imagine yet. We’re talking about healthcare revolutionizing how we diagnose and treat patients, transportation with autonomous vehicles and drones making logistics smarter and more efficient, and manufacturing, where AI will optimize production processes and supply chains.

Now, I know what you're thinking: 'What, you think the world is full of cave dwellers? Who doesn't know that?' and you're right. Everyone knows AI techonology will be advanced and utilized in so many ways in the near future.

But look, you can think of it like real estate. Sure, property values rise while new highways or shopping centers are being built, but the real surge in value happens once people start using them and see the full benefits. Right now, AI is still in its “under construction” phase—people can imagine the future potential, but the true value hasn’t been fully realized yet. The market has priced in expectations, sure, but once AI is fully integrated across industries and we start seeing its widespread, real-world impact, I believe we’ll see another major surge in stock prices. What’s priced in now is just the beginning—the real growth will come as AI starts transforming daily life and business on a much larger scale.

Before ChatGPT went mainstream, people assumed ‘just’ that level of AI technology would arrive soon enough, but they didn’t think it would have this much of an impact on stock prices once it came to life for the public. Everyone knew advanced AI was on the horizon, but the market didn’t price it like they do now. This shows just how much underestimation happens until we truly start experiencing the technology firsthand. And that’s why, despite what’s already been priced in, I think AI stocks are still undervalued given the game-changing growth ahead. Anyone else rethinking their portfolio with AI at the center?

Title: Amazon goes nuclear, to invest more than $500 million to develop small modular reactors
Text
 https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2024/10/16/amazon-goes-nuclear-investing-more-than-500-million-to-develop-small-module-reactors.html

Amazon Web Services is investing over $500 million in nuclear power, announcing three projects from Virginia to Washington State. AWS, Amazon's subsidiary in cloud computing, has a massive and increasing need for clean energy as it expands its services into generative AI. It's also a part of Amazon's path to net-zero carbon emissions.

AWS announced it has signed an agreement with Dominion Energy, Virginia's utility company, to explore the development of a small modular nuclear reactor, or SMR, near Dominion's existing North Anna nuclear power station. Nuclear reactors produce no carbon emissions.

An SMR is an advanced type of nuclear reactor with a smaller footprint that allows it to be built closer to the grid. They also have faster build times than traditional reactors, allowing them to come online sooner.

Amazon is the latest large tech company to buy into nuclear power to fuel the growing demands from data centers. Earlier this week, Google announced it will purchase power from SMR developer Kairos Power. Constellation Energy is restarting Three Mile Island to power Microsoft data centers.

"We see the need for gigawatts of power in the coming years, and there's not going to be enough wind and solar projects to be able to meet the needs, and so nuclear is a great opportunity," said Matthew Garman, CEO of AWS. "Also, the technology is really advancing to a place with SMRs where there's going to be a new technology that's going to be safe and that's going to be easy to manufacture in a much smaller form."

Virginia is home to nearly half of all the data centers in the U.S., with one area in Northern Virginia dubbed Data Center Alley, the bulk of which is in Loudon County. An estimated 70% of the world's internet traffic travels through Data Center Alley each day.

Dominion serves roughly 3,500 megawatts from 452 data centers across its service territory in Virginia. About 70% is in Data Center Alley. A single data center typically demands about 30 megawatts or greater, according to Dominion Energy. Bob Blue, its president and CEO, said in a recent quarterly earnings call that the utility now receives individual requests for 60 megawatts to 90 megawatts or greater. Dominion projects that power demand will increase by 85% over the next 15 years. AWS expects the new SMRs to bring at least 300 megawatts of power to the Virginia region.

"Small modular nuclear reactors will play a critical role in positioning Virginia as a leading nuclear innovation hub," said Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin in a release. "Amazon Web Services' commitment to this technology and their partnership with Dominion is a significant step forward to meet the future power needs of a growing Virginia."

AWS plans to invest $35 billion by 2040 to establish multiple data center campuses across Virginia, according to an announcement from Youngkin last year.

"These SMRs will be powering directly into the grid, so they'll go to power everything, part of that is the data centers, but everything that is plugged into the grid will benefit," Garman added.

Amazon also announced a new agreement with utility company Energy Northwest, a consortium of state public utilities, to fund the development, licensing and construction of four SMRs in Washington State. The reactors will be built, owned and operated by Energy Northwest but will provide energy directly to the grid, which will also help power Amazon operations.

Under the agreement, Amazon will have the right to purchase electricity from the first four modules. Energy Northwest has the option to build up to eight additional modules. That power would also be available to Amazon and Northwest utilities to power homes and businesses.

The SMRs will be developed with technology from Maryland-based X-energy, a developer of SMRs and fuel. Along with Amazon's other announcements, Amazon's Climate Pledge Fund disclosed it is the lead anchor in a $500 million financing round for X-Energy. The Climate Pledge Fund is its corporate venture capital fund that invests in early-stage sustainability companies. Other investors include Citadel Founder and CEO Ken Griffin, affiliates of Ares Management Corporation, NGP and the University of Michigan.

"Amazon and X-energy are poised to define the future of advanced nuclear energy in the commercial marketplace," said X-energy CEO J. Clay Sell. "To fully realize the opportunities available through artificial intelligence, we must bring clean, safe, and reliable electrons onto the grid with proven technologies that can scale and grow with demand."

Last spring, AWS invested in a nuclear energy project with Talen Energy, signing an agreement to purchase nuclear power from the company's existing Susquehanna Steam Electric Station, a nuclear power station in Salem Township, Pennsylvania. AWS also purchased the adjacent, nuclear-powered data center campus from Talen for $650 million.

 What are your thoughts on Robinhood Legend? I think the move upmarket is the right direction. Advanced trading features, index options etc for the browser is a very different user experience from the app.

I'm only familiar with Interactive Brokers Trader Workstation/Desktop at an enterprise level. But there are a dozen competitors here (TradingView etc). The multi-screen, dynamic linking features look good.

Combined with crypto, the Gold Card etc, Robinhood has definitely diversified its customer + product base. Very impressive and now it has room to go beyond its $25b market cap.

Title: Cloud software or Nuclear power. Which sector most benefit from massive data center infrastructure ?
Text
 Already heavily in semi-industry, so some diversification but stay close to tech industry (focus in smaller-cap high growth).

So far, I can only think of

data/cloud-related software Pro: fast-scale up, high gross margin. Cons: saas are growing slower and AI-capex return are worrying investors. Examples: servicenow, datadog etc. I also think about cloud cybersecurity stock like cloudflare (might benefit from more datacenter usages) but cybersecurity stock underperforms relative to others.

Nuclear power stocks, pro: real demand from data center (unlike cloud-software, capex surely pays off). cons: slow-scale up,  and regulation; Small modular reactors is easier comparing to traditional ones, but such manufacturing is U.S. weakness and could be potentially overwhelmed by China supply chain.

the recent hyped going much earlier than any of these reactors been built or put into use. Sounds like already miss out.  Not so sure about the moat and gross margin ?

which one is better to go?

Title: Sanofi: Influenza and Covid-19 vaccine strategy at risk?
Text
 Sanofi licensed the Matrix-M adjuvant from Novavax after Sanofis mRNA influenza vaccine development failed while Moderna succeded. Now Novavax is in trouble because of nerve damage that was potentially(!) caused by a traditional vaccine containing the Matrix-M adjuvant.

The results so far? Novavax stock price has declined more than 20%, Moderna stock price is down 2.5% and the Sanofi stock price is up a bit...

There are negative things to say about Novavax, but the Matrix-M adjuvant is really good and was the strategy for future Sanofi vaccines in the absence of mRNA vaccines. Now this adjuvant has potentially caused nerve damage. I don't think it's likely that the nerve damage is related to the Matrix-M adjuvant. But it could be. And I don't understand why that doesn't seem to concern anyone.

"**All three vaccine candidates contained Novavax's patented Matrix-M adjuvant** and showed reassuring preliminary safety profiles and reactogenicity that was comparable to Fluad and Fluzone HD."

Title: United Airlines plans $1.5 billion share buyback, beats estimates for Q3
Text
 United Airlines said Tuesday that it is starting a $1.5 billion share buyback as the carrier reported higher-than-expected earnings for the busy summer travel season and forecast strong results for the last three months of the year.

Shares of the airline were up roughly 9% in morning trading Wednesday, heading for their highest close since February 2020, before Covid-19 was declared a pandemic.

United expects to earn an adjusted $2.50 to $3.00 a share in the fourth quarter, compared to $2.00 a share a year earlier and the $2.68 analysts polled by LSEG estimated.

Here is what United reported for the third quarter compared with what Wall Street expected, based on average estimates compiled by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $3.33 adjusted vs. $3.17 expected

Revenue: $14.84 billion vs. $14.78 billion expected

The share buyback would be United’s first since before the Covid-19 pandemic. U.S. airlines received more than $50 billion in government aid during the pandemic travel slump that prohibited share repurchases and dividends, though airlines were still fighting for financial stability.

Southwest Airlines announced a $2.5 billion share repurchase program last month.

“Like other leading airlines and companies, we are initiating a measured, strategic share repurchase program,” United CEO Scott Kirby said in a note to staff on Tuesday. “Importantly, my commitment to you is that investing in our people and our business will always be my top priority even while we institute this share repurchase program.”

For the third quarter, United posted revenue of $14.84 billion, up 2.5% from a year earlier and above analysts’ estimates. It reported net income of $965 million, down 15% from a year ago.

United said domestic unit revenue was positive in August and September compared to last year as airlines trimmed a glut of flights that were pushing down fares. United expanded capacity by 4.1% in the third quarter. The carrier said corporate revenue rose 13% in the quarter; premium revenue, including business class tickets, rose 5%; and sales from its no-frills basic economy tickets were up 20%.

The airline last week unveiled a far-flung expansion for next year that included new flights to Mongolia, Senegal, Spain and Greenland in a chase for international travel demand.

Adjusting for one-time items, United reported earnings per share of $3.33, topping Wall Street forecasts and United’s estimate in July of $2.75 to $3.25 a share.

Airline executives will hold a call with analysts at 10:30 a.m. ET on Wednesday and will likely face questions about demand for the end of the year and into 2025, as well as production problems at Boeing, where most factories have been idled during a more than monthlong machinist strike.

United’s flight attendants’ union, which hasn’t yet reached a new labor agreement with the company slammed the airline’s decision to resume buybacks.

In a statement, Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, which represents crews at United, Spirit, Alaska and other carriers, said: “That money United just promised Wall Street belongs to Flight Attendants who worked throughout the pandemic and during this taxing recovery for all of us on the frontlines.”

Title: Large cap tech, Nvidia, and by extension US index funds are likely to crash, small cap value/international to outperform. Here's why
Text
 If you look at the story of how the S&amp;P500 has performed so well over the past decade, the answer is high return on invested capital from tech companies. By hiring top engineers to build innovative products, and scaling the product globally, these companies to achieved rapid growth at little cost, resulting in impressive returns to shareholders. Historically, hardware costs were very cheap to scale compared to the revenue it brings in. You could spend a few thousand per month in hosting costs, and bring in millions in profits.

However, this is changing. 7 out of 10 of the top holdings in the S&amp;P500 are gambling huge on AI- they have laid off tens of thousands of the talented engineers that drove their earnings growth, in order to fund expensive acquisitions of AI hardware(Not counting Nvidia because they are the ones profiting from it).

Tech can no longer be seen as an industry with low capital costs, because AI is tremendously expensive to deploy and maintain. For example, Microsoft expects to spend $100 Billion on AI datacenters through Fiscal 2027. That's 40% more than their entire profit in 2023. Because AI hardware is so expensive, and the electricity usage is so tremendous, these future applications are no longer cheap to deploy and maintain.

ChatGPT is perhaps the best example of this. Despite being tremendously successful from a growth perspective, it has been tremendously unprofitable from an operating standpoint, and relies on continued bailouts from large companies like Microsoft, Nvidia, and Softbank to stay afloat. 

The economics of tech companies is quickly changing; with companies in an arms race to acquire as many Nvidia chips as possible to build the best GenAI applications, they are hurting their margins and operating profitability.

The impact of these investments has been quite lousy so far; other than some round tripping transactions to create fake revenue and balance sheet growth, these ai investments, while tremendously expensive, have not paid off:

- Microsoft's CoPilot has been a complete failure, consumers are not buying CoPilot pcs, and the CoPilot app has a 2.3 star rating on the Windows store. They are also facing regulatory pressure in Europe over Recall.

- Google's AI is providing dangerous and potentially deadly misinformation to users of its search engine, such as incorrect advice about prescriptions.

- Amazon's "Go" stores were supposed to use ML/AI to handle checkouts, when in reality, the AI failed to handle most of the work, and the remainder was just outsourced to human operators in India which struggled to keep up with the workload.

- Tesla has still failed to implement full self driving, and during its robotaxi event, had human actors control the robots to fake them being AI controlled.

- Google's Waymo is very impressive from a technology standpoint, but its hardware costs and regulatory barriers make it unlikely to achieve profitability, even as it expands.

Despite the poor results of AI investments so far, all of the top 10 holdings in the S&amp;P500 other than Berkshire Hathaway trade at very high P/E Ratio, suggesting that very high earnings growth is priced in.

Even if AI will have a significant impact on the economy and society, the economics of it are not favorable to investors due to the high capex costs involved. Tech is no longer an industry where a team of 10-20 engineers can build a product that brings in Billions in revenue, with minimal hosting costs. It is now an industry where Billions of capital expenditures are needed just to build a model, and margins on the finished product are very poor.

Of course, tech CEOs realize this; which is why Microsoft, OpenAI, and Google are all working to replace Nvidia hardware, which sells at a huge markup, with their own in house chips. This is a tremendous threat to Nvidia's long term prospects.

Given the high expectations implied by elevated price to earnings ratios, and the poor financial performance of AI applications, it does seem quite unlikely that large caps will continue to outperform.

Small cap value and international stocks are almost certainly a better investment; if AI does drive significant productivity improvements, then labor heavy businesses will benefit from improved margins from using these products that large tech companies are offering.

Looking at small cap value funds like AVUV, and international stock indexes, there are a tremendous amount of labor intensive businesses with low margins in these funds that would benefit from AI/ML. Net margins going from 3% to 10% due to improved productivity would mean earnings more than tripling.

This has historically been the case with technical revolutions. For example, railroads revolutionized our economy and drove tremendous economic growth, but they provided terrible returns to shareholders.

 To be short, looking at the companies history and financials and how they operate, the company has money bags to hand out to investors in the form of dividends and still has, from what i can see around me (as a mechanic as my career) a HUGE runway for growth through $8000 toolboxes at 25% interest and i see their tools used in military application all the time because theyre extremely durable and easily warrantied.

Title: Qualcomm Said to Wait for US Election to Decide Intel Move
Text
 Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM) is likely to wait until after the US presidential election in November before deciding whether to pursue an offer to buy Intel Corp. (INTC), people familiar with the matter said.

San Diego-based Qualcomm wants greater clarity on the new occupant of the White House before deciding its next move because of the impact any future administration would have on the antitrust landscape and America’s relationship with China, according to the people, who asked not to be identified discussing confidential information.

Qualcomm could opt to wait until after the inauguration of the new US president in January before deciding how to proceed, given the many complexities of a potential transaction involving Intel, some of the people said.

A combination of Qualcomm and Intel, whose products are key to the digital framework supporting everyday life — from smartphones to electric vehicles — would almost certainly draw intense scrutiny from antitrust regulators in the US and around the world. That includes China, a key market for both Qualcomm and Intel.

Qualcomm made a preliminary approach to Intel on a possible takeover of its struggling rival in September. In the same month, the company made informal inquiries with antitrust regulators in China to gauge their stance on any potential deal, some of the people said. Qualcomm hasn’t received any feedback from Chinese authorities, which are waiting to see if the company actually makes a formal bid, they said.

Intel is at the heart of the US government’s plan for a homegrown chipmaking renaissance, making the political backing for any deal crucial. The Biden administration has consistently framed the importance of its chipmaking policy in national security terms. Intel is in line to get the biggest allocation of funding under the 2022 Chips and Science Act, if it goes ahead with all of its factory building plans. Qualcomm has been speaking with US regulators and believes an all-American combination could allay any concerns, people familiar with the matter have previously said.

Making a bid after the election may bring other advantages for Qualcomm. Intel will report third-quarter earnings later this month. If that follows the pattern of the disappointing announcement of three months ago and the impact it had on the potential target’s stock price, it could make a deal considerably less expensive for Qualcomm. This time around, analysts are predicting another net loss in excess of $1 billion for Intel.

Qualcomm’s deliberations are ongoing and there’s no certainty that the company will decide to pursue an offer for Intel and the timing could change, the people said. Representatives for Qualcomm and Intel declined to comment, while the State Administration for Market Regulation in China didn’t respond to requests for comment.

Under Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger, Intel has been working on an expensive plan to remake itself and bring in new products, technology and outside customers. As part of a recently announced shakeup, Intel intends to turn its programmable chip division into a standalone business and sell shares to the public or seek an investor for it.

Apollo Global Management Inc. has offered to make a multibillion-dollar investment in Intel, Bloomberg News reported last month, providing the chipmaker with a vote of confidence in its turnaround strategy and a possible alternative to any takeover by Qualcomm.

Title: Are lithium battery stocks a good buy?
Text
 Lithium batteries are used in the majority of devices we use every day; Laptops, Electric toothbrushes, E bikes, Electric tools, iPhones, vapes etc. they’re even used by manufacturing businesses within their heavy machinery and vehicles - FLASH BATTERY, these batteries are the most popular in Italy specifically and require 0 maintenance while also charging very quick compared to others available.

More importantly, with the ongoing climate crisis, governments of more economically developed countries are pushing their citizens to ‘go green’, promoting electric vehicles, bikes and even solar panels (solar panels can use lithium batteries to store extra energy). 

I am also aware however that sodium ions are a direct substitute to lithium, charging Even quicker and have an even greater life cycle. We seem to just be getting started with sodium ion batteries as the raw material supply chain isn’t very well developed.

What do we think?

 Question abt selling covered calls.  I have 100 shares of UAL. I can sell a call at strike price of $23 for $47.  I know the price will be over $23 and it will be executed.  

If it is executed, would I get the $47/share and the current market price of $70?  So $117/share?  Why wouldn’t I do this?

Title: Questions about company received RSUs.
Text
 I am still under educated in the world of stocks and have a few questions. I appreciate any and all help!

1. When selling RSUs I receive through my place of employment, how does the taxation work? Is it a simple capital gains tax on the increase of value since the day it officially vested or from the day I was awarded them and then made to sit through a vesting cycle? For example: I was awarded 55 RSUs in September of 2021 but they didn't vest, and enter my portfolio, until May 2022, Would those gains be from the September 2021 or May 2022?

  
2. If you sell multiple shares of stock and some have been yours for over a year and some not, are long term and short term capital gains taxes figured for each unit sold or is it a package deal? Are you able to choose which ones to sell individually or does it automatically choose FIFO or the opposite?

3. I have an account with Fidelity for my RSUs. Is there a way to see the length of time each RSU has been in my portfolio?

  
Thanks again!

Title: Google to buy nuclear power for AI datacentres in ‘world first’ deal
Text
 https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/oct/15/google-buy-nuclear-power-ai-datacentres-kairos-power

Google has signed a “world first” deal to buy energy from a fleet of mini nuclear reactors to generate the power needed for the rise in use of artificial intelligence.

The US tech corporation has ordered six or seven small nuclear reactors (SMRs) from California’s Kairos Power, with the first due to be completed by 2030 and the remainder by 2035.

Google hopes the deal will provide a low-carbon solution to power datacentres, which require huge volumes of electricity.

The US company, owned by Alphabet, said nuclear provided “a clean, round-the-clock power source that can help us reliably meet electricity demands”.

The explosive growth of generative AI, as well as cloud storage, has increased tech companies’ electricity demands.

Last month, Microsoft struck a deal to take energy from Three Mile Island, activating the plant for the first time in five years. The site, in Pennsylvania, was the location of the most serious nuclear meltdown in US history, in March 1979. Amazon bought a datacentre powered by nuclear energy in March from Talen Energy.

The locations of the new plants and financial details of the agreement were not revealed. Google has agreed to buy a total of 500 megawatts of power from Kairos, which was founded in 2016 and is building a demonstration reactor in Tennessee, due to be completed in 2027.

Michael Terrell, the senior director for energy and climate at Google, said: “The grid needs new electricity sources to support AI technologies that are powering major scientific advances, improving services for businesses and customers, and driving national competitiveness and economic growth.

“This agreement helps accelerate a new technology to meet energy needs cleanly and reliably, and unlock the full potential of AI for everyone.”

Title: Boeing to Sell at Least $10 Billion in Shares to Plug Cash Drain
Text
 *source:* [*https://www.wsj.com/business/boeing-needing-cash-moves-to-sell-new-shares-fce4c116?mod=hp\_lead\_pos1*](https://www.wsj.com/business/boeing-needing-cash-moves-to-sell-new-shares-fce4c116?mod=hp_lead_pos1)

[Boeing](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/BA) [BA -](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/BA) is moving to raise at least $10 billion by selling new shares in a bid to stabilize its increasingly precarious finances.

The jet maker, in a pair of regulatory filings on Tuesday, told investors it could issue up to $25 billion in shares or debt during the next three years while also entering into a new credit agreement with lenders.

Under the shelf registration, Boeing is expected to pursue a stock offering that raises around $10 billion, according to people familiar with the matter.

A [strike by Boeing’s largest union](https://www.wsj.com/business/airlines/boeing-strike-workers-reasons-explained-589c245e?mod=article_inline) is exacerbating financial woes at the jet maker, which last turned a profit in 2018. Its operations had been burning through about $1 billion a month before the strike.

Boeing ended September with $10.3 billion in cash and securities, close to the minimum amount the company has said it needs to operate. 

The new $10 billion credit agreement is in addition to about $10 billion in existing, untapped revolving credit agreements. Boeing has $45 billion in net debt.

“These are two prudent steps to support the company’s access to liquidity,” Boeing said in a statement. Boeing shares, which began the year around $250, were little changed in premarket trading near $150.

Credit-rating firms have warned that the company needed to raise capital and that its debt could be downgraded to junk status.

The company on Friday said it would [cut roughly 17,000 jobs](https://www.wsj.com/business/airlines/boeing-to-cut-10-of-workers-delay-new-plane-394370d5?mod=article_inline) and warned of deeper losses as production of most planes, including its bestselling 737, [is halted](https://www.wsj.com/business/boeing-strike-union-workers-walk-off-af5703df?mod=article_inline) amid a machinists’ strike under way since Sept. 13.

AGBA was previously trading as a penny stock from Hong Kong, which saw huge gains after the announcement of the merger, reaching at multiple points roughly twice the PPS that it was at before the recent string of good news (the lowest since April still being an order of magnitude above it's PPS prior to the initial announcement). As a Chinese stock, it's value was mainly propped up by the merger. **AGBA is now domesticating and moving it's headquarters to the USA in Delaware, and as a result is no longer a Chinese company.**

Triller was a private American corporation holding assets such as the **Triller app** (very similar concept to TikTok), Triller TV (a streaming service focused mainly on combat sports), and perhaps most valuable right now, is their majority stake in the **American Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship** (**BKFC**). Based in Philadelphia and founded in 2018, BKFC is the first promotion to hold an official state-sanctioned and commissioned bare-knuckle boxing event in the United States since 1889. **Partly owned by** **Conor McGregor** as of April 2024, it's often claimed to be "the fastest-growing combat sport in the world".

Previous AGBA shareholders received a 30% stake in the combined company, while Triller private investors received the other 70%. Importantly, **there is a 165 day lock-up where that 70% of the outstanding shares cannot be traded.** Furthermore, the stated valuation of the combined company according to the merger agreement is **$4 Billion USD (\~$30 per share) - around eight times it's current value if it is to be believed**.

There is a "strategic partnership" between the merged Triller company and Yorkville (YA II PN, LTD), which will come into effect very soon, the terms of which are shown in this 8-K [here](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001769624/000121390024059262/ea0208930-8k_agba.htm). Yorkville has control of a great deal of shares in the form of convertible debt. This will cause dilution, but it is also suspected that they are planning to leverage their power over the stock price to help pump it up significantly in order to get their money's worth and then some. They have not received any shares yet to my understanding, and are likely still holding down the stock's value to get an ideal entry point for at least a few days post-merger. It's not known with certainty, but it's suspected that Yorkville holds a very large short position on this stock, in part to keep the value down for their entry price, but potentially to also manipulate the value upwards after they buy-in by closing those short positions. This would offset the effect of dilution that their sales would have, and if timed right, may even trigger short squeezing and retail FOMO.

There has also been a great deal of hype regarding a **likely TikTok ban** which may come into effect in **mid-January**. The Triller app being a potential alternative to TikTok based in the USA puts it in a good position for massive growth following such a ban, especially if it can be improved using the combined assets of these merged companies. **Barring any delays, this catalyst would take place within the 165 day lock-up window of 70% of this stock's outstanding shares.**

The combination of these factors could spell out a very significant rally for $ILLR in the near future.

I'm currently holding 746 shares at a $4.95 average. My position has been at a 20-30% profit multiple times within the past couple weeks leading to the merger.

"Our momentum with clients continues to build following the successful completion of the Ameritrade conversion earlier this year," said Walt Bettinger, co-chairman and CEO of Charles Schwab.

Adjusted operating expenses during the quarter totaled $2.85 billion, slightly higher than our estimate of $2.83 billion, leading to an adjusted operating margin of 41.2%, exceeding management’s guidance of at least 40%."

Title: Stock recommendation for 7 years - Liquidity of around $110K
Text
 Here is the situation - I bought a house in 2022, with mortgage rate of 2.7% but with 10/1 ARM - so interest rate will change in 2032.    
I never plan to keep the mortgage for 30 years - something about owning money with me does not work - I have another hours bought in 2017 for $330k and paid it off by 2020 - currently converted this to rental and with a market value of roughly around 500K ( thanks covid)   
Coming back to the point, I have been saving money and have roughly around 110K towards paying off the house however I would be stupid if I pay off my mortgage as opposed to just putting it in one of high yield saving account or CD as those are paying more than what I am paying on my mortgage.   
  
I am looking for recommendation of "safe stock" with a vision of 7 years where I can park this money and hopefully dont loose it all. Looking at your advise/suggestions/recommendations for the same.   
  
Thanks.

Title: Found old stock certificate from Paragon Capital Corporation - 1991
Text
 I found this stock certificate in my father's papers - a stock certificate from Paragon Capital Corporation (incorporated in Utah) issued in 1991. A letter from them indicates it's a transfer of his interest in Jay Development Company Paullus A Lease, an Oil and Gas Lease. I'm struggling to find anything useful, even though the certificate has a CUSIP, and I'm Googling like crazy. Info is vague, contradictory, or requires payment, which we don't have. My parents' financial situation is so dire, we can't make their rent this month and they may have to leave their Assisted Living. While I suspect this certificate isn't worth anything, I need to make sure.

Does anyone have any idea about any of this? Any way to look up the CUSIP number that's free? Find out a value on this?

Many thanks.

Title: Nvidia closes at record as AI chipmaker's market cap tops $3.4 trillion
Text
 Nvidia shares closed at a record on Monday as Wall Street gears up for earnings season and updates from all of the chipmaker’s top customers on their planned spending on artificial intelligence infrastructure.

The stock climbed 2.4% to close at $138.07, topping its prior high of $135.58 on June 18. The shares are now up almost 180% for the year and have soared more than nine-fold since the beginning of 2023.

Nvidia, widely viewed as the company selling the picks and shovels for the AI gold rush, has been the biggest beneficiary of the generative AI boom, which started with the public release of OpenAI’s ChatGPT in November 2022. Nvidia’s graphics processing units (GPUs) are used to create and deploy advanced AI models that power ChatGPT and similar applications.

Companies including Microsoft, Meta, Google, and Amazon are purchasing Nvidia GPUs in large quantities to build increasingly large clusters of computers for their advanced AI work. Those companies are all slated to report quarterly results by the end of October.

Of the billions of dollars the top tech companies are spending annually on their AI buildouts, an outsized amount is going to Nvidia, which controls about 95% of the market for AI training and inference chips, according to analysts at Mizuho.

Nvidia’s revenue has more than doubled in each of the past five quarters, and at least tripled in three of those periods. Growth is expected to modestly slow the rest of the year, with analysts projecting expansion of about 82% to $32.9 billion in the quarter ending in October, according to LSEG.

Nvidia recently said that demand for its next-generation AI GPU called Blackwell is “insane” and it expects billions of dollars in revenue from the new product in the fourth quarter.

With a market cap of $3.4 trillion, Nvidia is the second most valuable publicly traded U.S. company, behind Apple at about $3.55 trillion.

Title: SPHD vs SCHD: Which ETF is Better for Dividends and Growth?
Text
 I'm looking to invest in a dividend-focused ETF and have narrowed it down to **SPHD** (Invesco S&amp;P 500 High Dividend Low Volatility ETF) and **SCHD** (Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF). Both seem like solid options, but I'm wondering which one might be better for a long-term investment strategy that balances **dividends** and **growth**. Could i buy both or should i sick to one

From what I can tell:

* **SPHD** focuses on high dividends and low volatility, which sounds great for income stability, but maybe it sacrifices growth?
* **SCHD** seems to focus more on companies with a consistent dividend history, which could lead to better long-term growth.

Title: Talk me out of loading up on $WOLF—2nd edition.
Text
 I’m back. Earlier this year, I made a similar post looking for bear cases on Wolfspeed before ignoring all of them and losing a bunch of money. While I may have been too early in hindsight, the fundamental situation is unchanged.

What has changed is an announcement yesterday that Wolfspeed will be receiving $750MM via the CHIPs act. The best bear case I heard last time was that China would subsidize and subsequently beat the shit out of WOLF. As I speculated, the US has now stepped up to say not so fast. 

A pop is happening now based on the news, but I am more interested in discussing a 2-3 year time horizon and the potential for shares to get into the $150 range.

So bears, where you at? Why can’t this company achieve $3b in annual revenue and profit margins in the mid 20% over the next 2-3 years without overly diluting or succumbing to high debt burden? From my perspective, they have crossed the chasm and done the hardest parts already, but where am I wrong?

Title: Any company you wanna short? Looking for empty air stocks with 70-100%+ run-ups in 2024
Text
 So obviously like most people, there's my index ETF portfolio. I want to hedge it against the risk of a "doom scenario" which we have been preparing for since 2021.

We all can offer excellent ideas on what companies are great, and which stocks to buy, but I'm looking for easy short ideas, so the inverse function -

* Empty air projections and growth expectations, no moat
* High regulatory risk, e.g. crypto 
* Sky high valuations, abnormal PE, PS ratios 
* Sky high run-up in price, e.g. 70-100% shoot up YTD
* Excessive media attention, which can quickly changes narrative

Couple of ideas that I can think of:

* Tesla (but who knows they might just deliver, finally)
* Walmart (digital is coming, digital is coming since 2010)
* Uber - discretionary spending in recession? Also, it spikes up when Tesla falls, so I don't like the rationale based on other company's failure 
* Vici - casino, hotels, resorts in recession? 
* And, please "murder me" for saying this - NVDA?

Title: Management fees
Text
 Hello folks, 
I was just a little curious how do the fees that are associated with certain funds actually paid.
For example, SCHD which has a fee of 0.6%, how do I as an investor end up paying that fee?

If the fund is 50 USD and rose up to 60 USD, at which point did I pay it and how?
I appreciate the answers in advance!

Title: r/Stocks Daily Discussion &amp; Technicals Tuesday - Oct 15, 2024

 This is the daily discussion, so anything stocks related is fine, but the theme for today is on technical analysis (TA), but if TA is not your thing then just ignore the theme.

Some helpful day to day links, including news:

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help **measure the trajectory of a security.**  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **"priced in"**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.
